                    application of x-rays and other technologies (such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance) to produce
                    and interpret images of the human body for the diagnosis of disease. <b>X-rays</b> are invisible
                    waves of energy that are produced by an energy source (such as an x-ray machine or cathode ray tube)
                    and are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0115"><b>Nuclear medicine</b> is the medical specialty that uses <b>radioactive
                        substances</b> in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These radioactive substances
                    <b>(radionuclides)</b> are materials that emit high-speed particles and energy-containing rays from
                    the interior of their matter. The emitted particles and rays are called <b>radioactivity</b> and can
                    be of three types: <b>alpha particles, beta particles,</b> and <b>gamma rays. Gamma rays</b> are
                    used effectively as a diagnostic label to trace the path and uptake of chemical substances in the
                    body.</div>

                        diagnosis and treatment of disease. Some of these characteristics are the following:</div>
                    <div>
                        <ul class="ce_list" id="olist0020">
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0135"><a id="o0100" />1. <b>Ability to cause exposure of a
                                    photographic plate.</b> If a photographic plate or other detector is placed in front
                                of a beam of x-rays, the x-rays, traveling unimpeded through the air, will expose the
                                silver coating of the plate and cause it to blacken. Solid state crystal detectors
                                (scintillation detectors) use crystals that fluoresce when struck by x-rays.</li>
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0140"><a id="o0105" />2. <b>Ability to penetrate different
                                    substances to varying degrees.</b> X-rays pass through the different types of
                                substances in the human body (air in the lungs, water in blood vessels and lymph, fat
                                around muscles, and metal such as calcium in bones) with varying ease. Air is the least
                                dense substance and allows the greatest transmission. Fat is denser, water is next,
                                followed by hard materials, such as calcium in bone, which is the densest and transmits
                                least. If the x-rays are absorbed (stopped) by the denser body substance (e.g., calcium
                                in bones), white areas are left in the x-ray detector. <a href="#f0015"
                                    id="Bf0015">Figure 20-1</a> is an example of an x-ray photograph.</li>
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0145">    A substance is said to be <b>radiolucent</b> if it
                                permits passage of most of the x-rays. Lung tissue (containing air) is an example of a
                                radiolucent substance, and it appears dark on an x-ray image. <b>Radiopaque</b>
                                substances (bones) are those that absorb most of the x-rays they are exposed to,
                                allowing only a small fraction of the x-rays to reach the x-ray plate. Thus, normally
                                radiopaque, calcium-containing bone appears white on an x-ray image.</li>
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0150"><a id="o0110" />3. <b>Invisibility.</b> X-rays cannot be
                                detected by sight, hearing, or touch. Workers exposed to x-rays must wear a <b>film
                                    badge</b> to detect and record the amount of radiation to which they have been
                                exposed. The film badge contains a special film that reacts when <span

                                of the amount of x-rays or gamma rays received by the wearer.</li>

                                                photograph (radiograph) of the hand.</b> The relative positions of the
                                            x-ray tube, patient (hand), and image detector necessary to make the x-ray
                                            photograph are shown. Bones tend to stop (absorb) diagnostic x-rays, but
                                            absorption of the x-ray energy occurs to a lesser degree with soft tissue.
                                            This results in the light and dark regions that form the image.</figcaption>

                            <li class="numlist" id="p0155"><a id="o0115" />4. <b>Travel in straight lines.</b> This
                                property allows the formation of precise shadow images on the x-ray plate and also
                                permits x-ray beams to be directed accurately at a tissue site during radiotherapy.</li>
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0160"><a id="o0120" />5. <b>Scattering of x-rays.</b> Scattering
                                occurs when x-rays come into contact with any material. Greater scatter occurs with
                                dense objects and less scatter with those substances that are radiolucent. In addition,
                                because scatter can cause blurring (radiographic density that serves no useful purpose)
                                on images, a grid (containing thin lead strips arranged parallel to the x-ray beams) is
                                placed in front of the image detector to absorb scattered radiation before it strikes
                                the x-ray film. In digital imaging, an x-ray detector replaces film.</li>
                            <li class="numlist" id="p0165"><a id="o0125" />6. <b>Ionization.</b> X-rays have the ability
                                to ionize substances through which they pass. Ionization is a chemical process in which
                                the energy of an x-ray beam causes rearrangement and disruption within a substance so
                                that previously neutral particles are changed to charged particles called <b>ions.</b>
                                This strongly ionizing ability of x-rays is a double-edged sword. In x-ray or radiation
                                therapy, the ionizing effect of high-energy x-ray beams can help kill cancerous cells
                                and stop tumor growth; however, ionizing x-rays in even small doses can affect normal
                                body cells, leading to tissue damage and malignant changes. Thus, persons exposed to
                                high doses of x-rays are at risk for the development of leukemia, thyroid tumors, breast
                                cancer, or other malignancies.</li>

                            conditions. <b>Digital radiography</b> is a form of x-ray imaging in which digital x-ray
                            detectors are used instead of traditional photographic film. Thus images can be enhanced and
                            transferred easily, and less radiation can be used than in conventional radiography. The
                            chest x-ray is the most commonly performed diagnostic x-ray examination. Another common use
                            of x-rays is in dental practice to locate caries in teeth. <b>Mammography</b> uses low-dose
                            x-rays to visualize breast tissue. Some special diagnostic x-ray techniques are described
                            next.</div>

                            <div class="textfl" id="p0175">The CT scan, sometimes called “CAT scan” (because the
                                technique originally was known as “computerized axial tomography”), is made by beaming
                                x-rays at multiple angles through a section of the patient’s body. The absorption of all
                                of these x-rays, after they pass through the body, is recorded and used by a computer to
                                create multiple cross-sectional images (<a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 20-2</a>).
                                The ability of a CT scanner to detect abnormalities is increased with the use of
                                iodine-containing contrast agents, which outline blood vessels and confer additional
                                density to soft tissues.</div>

                                and can actually provide images of internal organs that are impossible to visualize with

                                State-of-the-art scanners produce 64, 128, 256, and 320 images per rotation and are

                            <div class="textfl" id="p0185">In radiography, the natural differences in the density of
                                body tissues (e.g., from air in lung or from calcium in bone) produce contrasting
                                shadows on the radiographic image. However, when x-rays pass through two adjacent body
                                parts composed of substances of the same density (e.g., different digestive organs in
                                the abdomen), their shadows cannot be distinguished from one another on the film or on
                                the screen. It is necessary, then, to place a <b>contrast medium</b> into the structure

                                (therapeutic or diagnostic), usually under CT or ultrasound guidance or with
                                fluoroscopic imaging. <b>Fluoroscopy</b> is the use of x-rays and a fluorescent screen
                                to produce real-time video images. Procedures include percutaneous biopsy, placement of
                                drainage catheters, drainage of abscesses, occlusion of bleeding vessels, and catheter

                                (liver, kidney, lungs, and adrenals). Neurointerventional radiologists perform

                            give information about the anatomy of an internal organ. An instrument called a
                            <b>transducer</b> or <b>probe</b> is placed near or on the skin, which is covered with a
                            thin coating of gel to ensure good transmission of sound waves. The transducer emits sound
                            waves in short, repetitive pulses. The ultrasound waves move through body tissues and detect
                            interfaces between tissues of different densities. An echo reflection of the sound waves is
                            formed as they hit the various body tissues and bounce back to the transducer.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0230">These ultrasonic echoes are then recorded as a composite picture of

                        disintegrates. Radionuclides are produced in either a nuclear reactor or a charged-particle
                        accelerator (cyclotron) or by irradiating stable substances, causing disruption and instability.
                        <b>Half-life</b> is the time required for a radioactive substance (radionuclide) to lose half of
                        its radioactivity by disintegration. Knowledge of a radionuclide’s half-life is important in
                        determining how long the radioactive substance will emit radioactivity when in the body. The
                        half-life must be long enough to allow for diagnostic imaging but as short as possible to
                        minimize patient exposure to radiation.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0350">Radionuclides emit three types of radioactivity: <b>alpha particles,
                            beta particles,</b> and <b>gamma rays.</b> Gamma rays, which have greater penetrating
                        ability than alpha and beta particles, and more ionizing power, are especially useful to
                        physicians in both the diagnosis and the treatment of disease. <b>Technetium-99m</b>
                        (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) is essentially a pure gamma emitter with a half-life of 6 hours. Its
                        properties make it the most frequently used radionuclide in diagnostic imaging.</div>

                        procedures. <b>In vitro</b> procedures involve analysis of blood and urine specimens using
                        radioactive chemicals. For example, a <b>radioimmunoassay (RIA)</b> is an in vitro procedure
                        that combines the use of radioactive chemicals and antibodies to detect hormones and drugs in a
                        patient’s blood. The test allows the detection of minute amounts of substances or compounds. RIA
                        is used to monitor the amount of digitalis, a drug used to treat heart disease, in a patient’s
                        bloodstream and can detect hypothyroidism in newborn infants.<span role="doc-pagebreak"

                        image it. For example, in <b>tracer studies,</b> a specific radionuclide is incorporated into a
                        chemical substance and administered to a patient. The combination of the radionuclide and a drug
                        or chemical is called a <b>radiopharmaceutical</b> (or <b>radiolabeled compound</b>). Each
                        radiopharmaceutical is designed to concentrate in a certain organ. The organ can then be imaged

                                to be excreted in urine and allows for better visualization of the radioactive material
                                remaining in the skeleton. The scan detects infection, inflammation, or tumors involving

                                radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), but others are in use. PET scanning has

                                    <div class="b1textfl" id="p0500">Before an upcoming surgical procedure, I was told
                                        that I would need to have a CT scan. The doctors wanted to see if the cancer on
                                        my scalp had spread into the bones in my skull. They explained that these images
                                        of my head would be in thin “slices,” taken as the CT camera rotated around me.
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0505">When I arrived in the room, I saw the CT machine. It
                                        was a large, circular hollow tube about 18 inches wide. There was a narrow table
                                        through the center. It was clear to me immediately that I would not have to
                                        worry about feeling “closed in.” I lay down on the table, and the technician
                                        explained he would add contrast through an intravenous (IV) line halfway through
                                        the procedure.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0510">The table was rolled into the machine to a specific
                                        spot where a series of pictures was taken. There were several short periods when
                                        I was asked to stay as still as possible and hold my breath. The noise was
                                        minimal, just soft whirring and clicking. Halfway through the procedure, I was
                                        slid out of the machine on the table so that the contrast could be added to the
                                        IV line. Once I was back in the machine, more pictures were taken and the test
                                        was completed with a minimum of discomfort, much to my grateful surprise.</div>

                                    <div class="b1textfl" id="p0515">Before yet another surgical procedure, my doctors
                                        requested an MRI exam. This time, they wanted to get the best possible image of
                                        my malignant tumor and the surrounding area. They explained that the MRI and CT
                                        procedures are similar in that they both produce images in thin slices, but that
                                        the MRI shows more detail, especially of soft tissue.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0520">The technician confirmed that I had nothing metal
                                        (such as a pacemaker or surgical screws) inside or on my body. The magnet that
                                        is used in the MRI machine is so strong that it could cause any metal objects to
                                        shift. This movement could disrupt the imaging process or cause damage to tissue
                                        in my body.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0525">The MRI machine is a 6-foot-long round tube, open on
                                        both ends. Because the body part to be examined was my head, a rubber shield was
                                        placed over and very close to my face to hold me in the correct position. I was
                                        then rolled inside to the middle of the tube. This was really uncomfortable for
                                        me because I have mild claustrophobia. I took deep breaths to relax myself.
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0530">Although the technicians had told me the procedure
                                        would be loud, I was still taken aback by the loud thumping, knocking, and
                                        clicking sounds even while wearing earplugs. I knew that the MRI experience
                                        could be overwhelming, so I used a “relax-substitution” method to replace these
                                        sounds with more familiar ones. I thought about a time my family and I made our
                                        way to Nantucket Island for a vacation, and I substituted the welcoming sound of
                                        the ferry horn for the imposing sounds I was hearing in the machine. This method
                                        helped me to get through the test and made repeating the scan with the addition
                                        of the IV contrast not so formidable.</div>

                                    <div class="b1textfl" id="p0555">Bill Smith, a 51-year-old sales representative, was
                                        initially diagnosed with stage III melanoma 4 years ago. He underwent surgery
                                        and received interferon treatment at that time. At his 3-month follow-up CT
                                        evaluation last year, Mr. Smith received bad news. The CT scan detected a 1 cm
                                        nodule that could be a melanoma metastasis. To confirm the diagnosis, Mr. Smith
                                        underwent a PET scan.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0560">He was admitted to the nuclear medicine unit of the
                                        hospital on the morning of the scan. He had been instructed to fast (no food or
                                        beverage 12 hours before the scan). The nuclear medicine physician had told him
                                        especially not to eat any type of sugar, which would compete with the
                                        radiopharmaceutical 18F-FDG (radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose,
                                        <sup>18</sup>F-FDG), a radioactive glucose molecule that travels to every cell
                                        in the body.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0565">The PET scan began with an injection of a trace
                                        amount of 18F-FDG by the physician. Bill was asked to lie still for about an
                                        hour in a dark, quiet room and to avoid talking to prevent the compound from
                                        concentrating in the tongue and vocal cords. The waiting time allowed the
                                        18F-FDG to be absorbed and released from normal tissue. After emptying his
                                        bladder, Bill reclined on a bed that moved slowly and quietly through a PET
                                        scanner, a large tube similar to a CT scanner. The radioactive glucose emits
                                        charged particles called positrons, which interact with electrons, producing
                                        gamma rays that are in turn detected by the scanner. Color-coded images indicate
                                        the intensity of metabolic activity throughout the body. Cancerous cells absorb
                                        more radioactive glucose than noncancerous cells. The malignant cells show up
                                        brighter on the PET scan.</div>
