                <div class="textfl" id="p0130">Body cells are dependent on a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen.
                    When the supplies are delivered and then chemically combined, they release the energy necessary to
                    do the work of each cell. How does the body ensure that oxygen and food will be delivered to all of
                    its cells? The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart (a powerful muscular pump) and blood
                    vessels (fuel line and transportation network), performs this important work. This chapter explores
                    terminology related to the heart and blood vessels.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0135">There are three types of blood vessels in the body: <b>arteries,
                            veins, and capillaries.</b></div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0140"><b>Arteries</b> are large blood vessels that carry blood away from the
                        heart. Their walls are lined with connective tissue, muscle tissue, and elastic fibers, with an
                        innermost layer of epithelial cells called <b>endothelium.</b> Endothelial cells, found in all
                        blood vessels, secrete factors that affect the size of blood vessels, reduce blood clotting, and
                        promote the growth of blood vessels. Because arteries carry blood away from the heart, they must
                        be strong enough to withstand the high pressure of the pumping action of the heart. Their
                        elastic walls allow them to expand as the heartbeat forces blood into the arterial system
                        throughout the body.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0145">Smaller branches of arteries are <b>arterioles.</b> Arterioles are
                        thinner than arteries and carry the blood to the tiniest of blood vessels, the capillaries.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0150"><b>Capillaries</b> have walls that are only one endothelial cell in
                        thickness. These delicate, microscopic vessels carry nutrient-rich, oxygenated blood from the
                        arteries and arterioles to the body cells. Their thin walls allow passage of oxygen and
                        nutrients out of the bloodstream and into cells. There, the nutrients are burned in the presence
                        of oxygen (catabolism) to release energy. At the same time, waste products such as carbon
                        dioxide and water pass out of cells and into the thin-walled capillaries. Waste-filled blood
                        then flows back to the heart in small <b>venules,</b> which combine to form larger vessels
                        called veins.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0155"><b>Veins</b> have thinner walls compared with arteries. They conduct
                        blood (that has given up most of its oxygen) toward the heart from the tissues. Veins have
                        little elastic tissue and less connective tissue than that typical of arteries, and blood
                        pressure in veins is extremely low compared with pressure in arteries. In order to keep blood
                        moving back toward the heart, veins have <b>valves</b> that prevent the backflow of blood and
                        keep the blood moving in one direction. Muscular action also helps the movement of blood in
                        veins. <a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 11-1</a> illustrates the differences in blood

                        and <b>systole</b> (contraction). Diastole occurs when the ventricle walls relax and blood flows
                        into the heart from the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins. The tricuspid and mitral valves
                        open in diastole, as blood passes from the right and left atria into the ventricles. The
                        pulmonary and aortic valves close at beginning of diastole. (<a href="#f0050" id="Bf0050">Figure
                            11-8</a>).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0275">Systole occurs next, as the walls of the right and left ventricles
                        contract to pump blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Both the tricuspid and the
                        mitral valves are closed during systole, thus preventing the flow of blood back into the atria
                        (see <a href="#f0050">Figure 11-8</a>).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0280">This diastole-systole cardiac cycle occurs between 70 and 80 times per
                        minute (100,000 times a day). The heart pumps about 3 ounces of blood with each contraction.
                        This means that about 5 quarts of blood are pumped by the heart in 1 minute (75 gallons an hour
                        and about 2000 gallons a day).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0285">Closure of the heart valves is associated with audible sounds, such as
                        “lubb-dubb,” which can be heard on listening to a normal heart with a stethoscope. The “lubb” is
                        associated with closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves at the beginning of systole, and the
                        “dubb” with the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves at the end of systole. The “lubb”
                        sound is called the first heart sound (S1) and the “dubb” is the second heart sound (S2),
                        because the normal cycle of the heartbeat starts with the beginning of systole. Sometimes the
                        flow of blood through the valves can produce an abnormal swishing sound known as a
                        <b>murmur.</b>

                        impulse originates. This is the <b>sinoatrial node (SA node),</b> or <b>pacemaker</b> [1] of the
                        heart. The current of electricity generated by the pacemaker causes the walls of the atria to

                        within the interatrial septum and is the <b>atrioventricular node (AV node)</b> [2]. The AV node
                        immediately sends the excitation wave to a bundle of specialized muscle fibers called the
                        <b>atrioventricular bundle,</b> or <b>bundle of His</b> [3]. Within the interventricular septum,
                        the bundle of His divides into the <b>left bundle branch</b> [4] and the <b>right bundle
                            branch</b> [5], which form the conduction myofibers that extend through the ventricle walls
                        and contract on stimulation. Thus systole occurs and blood is pumped away from the heart. A
                        short rest period follows, and then the pacemaker begins the wave of excitation across the heart
                        again.

                    arteries).</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0335">As air continues to escape, the sounds become progressively louder.
                    Finally, when a change in sound from loud to soft occurs, the observer makes note of the pressure on
                    the recording device. This is the diastolic pressure (pressure in the artery when the ventricles
                    relax and the heart fills, receiving blood from the venae cavae and pulmonary veins).</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0340">Blood pressure is expressed as a fraction—for example, 120/80 mm Hg, in
                    which the upper number (120) is the systolic pressure and the lower number (80) is the diastolic
                    pressure. A new guideline lowers the target for hypertension (high blood pressure) treatment to
                    130/80. Both the systolic and diastolic components of hypertension are associated with increased
                    risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death.<span role="doc-pagebreak"

                                <div class="b1textfl" id="p0445">The pacemaker leads (wires) detect the heart’s own
                                    electrical activity and transmit that information to the generator (computer). The
                                    computer analyzes the heart’s signals and decides when and where to pace. If the
                                    rate is slow, the generator emits a signal to stimulate contraction and increase the
                                    rate. Pacemakers with multiple leads can pace the atrium and ventricle in proper
                                    sequence. Rate-responsive pacemakers have sensors that detect body movement and
                                    breathing to then determine the best heart rate.</div>

                                A. Normal sinus rhythm. Notice the regularity of the P, QRS, and T waves. B. Atrial
                                flutter. Notice the rapid atrial rate (P wave) compared with the slower. ventricular
                                rate (QRS). C. Atrial fibrillation. P waves are replaced by irregular and rapid
                                fluctuations. There are no effective atrial contractions. D. Ventricular tachycardia.
                                Ventricular rate may be as high as 250 beats per minute. The rhythm is regular, but the
                                atria are not contributing to ventricular filling and blood output is poor. E.
                                Ventricular fibrillation. Notice the abnormal, irregular waves. Ventricles in
                                fibrillation cannot pump blood effectively. Circulation stops and sudden cardiac death
                                follows if fibrillation is not reversed.</p>

                                    atrial fibrillation off and on for several months. I got tired easily, and I could
                                    feel my blood pressure drop. After lying down for about an hour, I was fine, so in

                                    work out every day on a treadmill and a recumbent bike, so the test on the treadmill
                                    wasn’t that difficult, although I loved the words “just a couple of seconds to go.”

                                    felt it, particularly when the doctor hit a problem and had to make a slight
                                    correction. I was certain that they would put in a stent and I’d be home by the

                                    death. Secondly, I was fortunate to have some true professionals on hand to get me
                                    through the darkest days of my life. Many people who had bypass surgery told me I
                                    would have more energy after surgery due to my new plumbing. That occurred 6 to 7
