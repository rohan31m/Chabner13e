					<h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Introduction</h2>
					<div class="textfl" id="p0115">The male sex cell, the <b>spermatozoon</b> (sperm cell), is microscopic—in volume, only one third the size of a red blood cell and less than 1/100,000 the size of the female ovum. A relatively uncomplicated cell, the sperm is composed of a head region, containing nuclear hereditary material (chromosomes), and a tail region, consisting of a <b>flagellum</b> (hair-like process). The flagellum makes the sperm motile and makes it look somewhat like a tadpole. The spermatozoon cell contains relatively little food and cytoplasm, because it lives only long enough (3 to 5 days) to travel from its point of release from the male to where the egg cell lies within the female reproductive tract (fallopian tube). Only one spermatozoon out of approximately 300 million sperm cells released during a single <b>ejaculation</b> (ejection of sperm and fluid from the male urethra) can penetrate a single ovum and result in fertilization of the ovum. <a href="#f0010" id="Bf0010">Figure 9-1</a> shows a diagram of a <b>sperm cell</b> and a photograph of <b>spermatozoa</b>.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0120">If more than one egg is passing down the fallopian tube when sperm are present, multiple fertilizations are possible, and twins, triplets, quadruplets, and so on may occur. Twins resulting from the fertilization of separate ova by separate sperm cells are called <b>fraternal twins.</b> Fraternal twins, developing with separate placentas, can be of the same sex or different sexes and resemble each other no more than ordinary brothers and sisters. Fraternal twinning is hereditary; the daughters of mothers of twins can carry the gene.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0125"><b>Identical twins</b> result from fertilization of a single egg cell by a single sperm. As the fertilized egg cell divides and forms many cells, it somehow splits, and each part continues separately to undergo further division, each producing an embryo. The split usually occurs between the third and fifth days of embryonic development. Most identical twins have one placenta and two amniotic sacs. Identical twins have the same DNA and are, therefore, of the same sex and of very similar form and feature.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0130">The organs of the male reproductive system are designed to produce and release billions of spermatozoa throughout the lifetime of a male from puberty onward. In addition, the male reproductive system secretes a hormone called <b>testosterone.</b> Testosterone is responsible for the production of the bodily characteristics of the male (such as beard, pubic hair, and deeper voice) and for the proper development of male gonads <b>(testes)</b> and accessory organs <b>(prostate gland</b> and <b>seminal vesicles)</b> that secrete fluids to ensure the lubrication and viability of sperm.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="293" id="pagebreak_293" /><a id="pg293" /></div>

					<div class="textfl" id="p0135">Label <a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 9-2</a> as you study the following description of the anatomy of the male reproductive system.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0140">Each male gonad is a <b>testis</b> [1]. There are two <b>testes</b> (plural) or <b>testicles</b> that develop in the abdomen at about the level of the kidneys before descending during embryonic development into the <b>scrotum</b> [2], a sac enclosing the testes on the outside of the body.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0145">The scrotum, lying between the thighs, exposes the testes to a lower temperature than that of the rest of the body. This lower temperature is necessary for the adequate maturation and development of sperm <b>(spermatogenesis).</b> Located between the anus and the scrotum, at the floor of the pelvic cavity in the male, the <b>perineum</b> [3] is analogous to the perineal region in the female.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0150">The interior of a testis is composed of a large mass of narrow, coiled tubules called the <b>seminiferous tubules</b> [4]. These tubules contain cells that manufacture spermatozoa. The seminiferous tubules are the <b>parenchymal tissue</b> of the testis, which means that they perform the essential work of the organ (formation of sperm). Other cells in the testis, lying adjacent to seminiferous tubules, are <b>interstitial cells.</b> They manufacture an important male hormone, <b>testosterone.</b></div>
					<div class="text" id="p0155">All body organs contain <b>parenchyma</b>, which perform the essential functions of the organ. Organs also contain supportive, connective, and framework tissue, such as blood vessels, connective tissues, and sometimes muscle as well. This supportive tissue is called <b>stroma (stromal tissue).</b></div>

					<div id="group5_printable" class="printable_group">



<div id="group5_placeholder" class="question-group">
</div>
							
						</div>

					<div class="text" id="p0160">After formation, sperm cells move through the seminiferous tubules and collect in ducts that lead to a large tube, the <b>epididymis</b> [5], at the upper part of each testis. The spermatozoa mature, become motile in the epididymis, and are temporarily stored there. An epididymis <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="294" id="pagebreak_294" /><a id="pg294" />runs down the length of each testicle (the coiled tube is about 16 feet long) and then turns upward again and becomes a narrow, straight tube called the <b>vas deferens</b> [6] or <b>ductus deferens.</b> <a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 9-3</a> shows the internal structure of a testis and the epididymis. The vas deferens is about 2 feet long and carries the sperm up into the pelvic region, at the level of the urinary bladder, merging with ducts from the <b>seminal vesicles</b> [7] to form the <b>ejaculatory duct</b> [8] leading toward the urethra. During a <b>vasectomy</b> or <b>sterilization</b> procedure, the urologist cuts and ties off each vas deferens by making an incision in the scrotum.</div>

					</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0165">The seminal vesicles, two glands (only one is shown in <a href="#f0015">Figure 9-2</a>) located at the base of the bladder, open into the ejaculatory duct as it joins the <b>urethra</b> [9]. They secrete a thick, sugary, yellowish substance that nourishes the sperm cells and forms a portion of ejaculated semen. <b>Semen,</b> a combination of fluid (seminal fluid) and spermatozoa (sperm cells account for less than 1% of the semen volume), is ejected from the body through the urethra. In the male, as opposed to that in the female, the genital orifice combines with the urinary (urethral) opening.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0170">The <b>prostate gland</b> [10] lies at the region where the vas deferens enters the urethra, almost encircling the upper end of the urethra. It secretes a milky white fluid that is a mixture of sugars, enzymes, and alkaline chemicals. As part of semen, this fluid is nutritious for sperm cells, and after ejaculation into the vagina, the alkaline chemicals promote the survival of sperm in the acidic environment of the vagina. Muscular tissue of the prostate aids in the expulsion of fluid during ejaculation. <b>Bulbourethral glands</b> [11], lying below the prostate gland, also secrete fluid into the urethra during ejaculation.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0175">The urethra passes through the <b>penis</b> [12] to the outside of the body. The penis is composed of erectile tissue and at its tip expands to form a soft, sensitive region called the <b>glans penis</b> [13]. Ordinarily, a fold of skin called the <b>prepuce,</b> or <b>foreskin</b> [14], covers the glans penis. The foreskin is attached to the glans penis in uncircumcised babies. Between 2 and 10 years of age, the foreskin naturally detaches and can be pulled back from the head of the penis. If an infant is circumcised, the foreskin is removed, leaving the glans penis visible at all times.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0180"><b>Erectile dysfunction (impotence)</b> is the inability of the adult male to achieve an erection. Viagra (sildenafil), Cialis (tadalafil), and Stendra (avanafil) are drugs that increase blood flow to the penis, enhancing ability to have an erection. <b>Male infertility</b> is any problem in a man that lowers the chances of his female partner getting pregnant.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0185">The flow diagram in <a href="#f0025" id="Bf0025">Figure 9-4</a> traces the path of spermatozoa from their formation in the seminiferous tubules of the testes to the outside of the body.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="295" id="pagebreak_295" /><a id="pg295" /></div>

Urinary obstruction and inability to empty the bladder completely are symptoms. <a href="#f0050" id="Bf0050">Figure 9-9</a> shows the prostate gland with BPH and with carcinoma. Surgical treatment by <b>transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)</b> relieves the obstruction, but overgrowth of cells may recur over several years. In this procedure, an endoscope (resectoscope) is inserted into the penis and through the urethra. Prostatic tissue is removed by an electrical hot loop attached to the resectoscope (see page 305).</div>
														<div class="tb1">Several drugs to relieve BPH symptoms have been approved by the FDA. Finasteride (Proscar) inhibits production of a potent testosterone that promotes enlargement of the prostate. Other drugs, alpha blockers such as tamsulosin (Flomax), act by relaxing the smooth muscle of the prostate and the neck of the bladder.</div>

														<div class="tb1">Diagnosis requires finding tumor in a needle biopsy of the prostate. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guides the needle biopsy taken through the rectal wall (trans-rectal). Multiple needle biopsy specimens are taken. Computed tomography (CT) detects lymph node metastases. The <b>PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)</b> imaging scan is most useful for early detection of metastases at the time of staging the tumor, or in patients with a rising PSA after primary treatment. PSMA is a very sensitive, new diagnostic tool for detecting small metastatic sites, usually located in bone. <span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780443107795000099/main.assets/icon01-9780443107795.jpg" alt="icon"/></span></div>
														<div class="tb1">Treatment consists of surgery, which can be radical (open prostatectomy) or robotic (laparoscopic prostatectomy). Hormonal therapy is used for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Because prostatic cells are stimulated to grow in the presence of androgens, antiandrogen drugs slow tumor growth. One such drug is Lupron, which reduces the level of androgens in the bloodstream. Many new anti-androgens plus chemotherapy are effective in stopping tumor growth. Radiation therapy includes brachytherapy (brachy = near), which means that radioactive seeds are implanted directly into the prostate gland. See the <b><i>In Person: Prostate Cancer</i></b> story on page 309.</div>

									<div class="b1textfl" id="bpar0360">The <b>Gleason score</b> (named after Dr. Donald Gleason, a pathologist who developed it in the 1960s) is based on the microscopic appearance of the prostate biopsy specimen.

The pathologist assigns a grade (number) to the most common tumor cells and another to the next most common tumor cells. Adding these numbers together gives the Gleason score. The score is based on a scale from 1 to 5. More well-differentiated (closer to normal) cells are given a lower grade, and poorly differentiated (malignant) cells are given a higher grade.</div>

									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0370"><i>This is a first-person narrative of a man diagnosed with prostate cancer.</i></div>
									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0375">As with many men in their late 50s, the PSA prostate-related lab test was the first item I would always look at when having my annual physical. Over a few years, the PSA had been going up gradually, but nothing that seemed to indicate anything unusual. So it was a bit of a surprise when my primary care doctor suggested that it might be time to have a further medical review of the slowly increasing results. The PSA was 4.37 ng/mL (4.0 or less is considered normal).</div>
									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0380">Being in good overall health, I expected the follow-up prostate exam and biopsy to be of a routine nature. It was with great surprise that the prostate biopsy showed that 3 of 12 samples were positive for cancerous cells. My Gleason score was 6 (3 + 3). This situation was described to me as favorable, an early-stage cancer. Nevertheless, I had no idea of the treatment options available.</div>
									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0385">I decided that the best way to reach a decision for a treatment plan was to get together with the doctors at the Mass General Cancer Center genitourinary clinic, where my situation would be reviewed, and to learn more about my options. I realized that the possibilities ranged widely, including watchful waiting, external radiation, internal radiation, and prostate surgery (prostatectomy). In the end, the decision becomes your own in early-stage prostate cancer, and that, in itself, can leave you second-guessing the choice.</div>
									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0390">After careful thought and review of the information with my physicians and family, I decided to pursue the internal radiation option, or brachytherapy, often referred to as implantation of radiation seeds. Even up to the time of the procedure, the question remained with me as to whether I was making the right choice. Should I wait a while and just see how things go? Would there be any of the side effects that are noted for this procedure, such as bowel or bladder irritation? I had the internal radiation done at MGH. The entire medical team there made the process from start to completion as easy an event as one could hope for. The best news was that after the procedure, as tumor disappeared, my PSA began to drop.</div>

										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0395">Now a year has passed, and I am happy to see that the PSA has continued downward. The long-term side effects of the brachytherapy procedure were related to urination and erectile dysfunction. While urination post-procedure was painful, discomfort dissipated within a week or so. Long term, managing the control of urination was an issue, but after a year it has definitely improved. Erectile dysfunction after any type of prostate procedure is an issue. I found it to be a major effect early on, but less as time progressed. There is still the required PSA testing to see that the tumor has not returned. But taking warning signs seriously, educating yourself, and making an informed decision with the help of the best medical team possible will make you feel good about your choices.</div>
