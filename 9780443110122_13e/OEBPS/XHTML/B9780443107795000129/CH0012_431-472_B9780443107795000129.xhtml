                <div class="textfl" id="p0110">We usually think of <b>respiration</b> as the mechanical process of
                    breathing, the exchange of air between the lungs and the external environment. This exchange of air
                    at the lungs is called <b>external respiration.</b> During <b>inhalation,</b> oxygen passes from the
                    environment (inhaled air contains about 21%) into the lung air sacs and blood capillaries of lungs.
                    Simultaneously, during <b>exhalation</b> carbon dioxide, a gas waste product produced when oxygen
                    and food combine in cells, passes from the capillary blood vessels into the air sacs of the lungs to
                    be exhaled.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0115">Whereas external respiration occurs between the outside environment and the
                    capillary blood of the lungs, another form of respiration occurs within the individual body cells.
                    This is <b>internal (cellular) respiration</b>, which involves the production of energy from oxygen
                    and food within body cells. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of this form of respiration. Carbon
                    dioxide passes from body cells into the tissue capillaries to travel to the lungs for exhalation.

                    following paragraphs that describe the respiratory organs and their functions.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0125">Air enters the body via the <b>nose</b> [1] through two openings called
                    nostrils or <b>nares.</b> Air then passes through the <b>nasal cavity</b> [2], lined with a mucous
                    membrane and fine hairs <b>(cilia)</b> to help filter out foreign bodies, as well as to warm and
                    moisten the air. <b>Paranasal sinuses</b> [3] are hollow, air-containing spaces within the skull
                    that communicate with the nasal cavity. They, too, have a mucous membrane lining. Besides producing
                    mucus, a lubricating fluid, the sinuses lighten the bones of the skull and help produce sound.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0130">After passing through the nasal cavity, the air next reaches the <b>pharynx
                        (throat).</b> There are three divisions of the pharynx. The first is the <b>nasopharynx</b> [4].
                    It contains the <b>pharyngeal tonsils,</b> or <b>adenoids</b> [5], which are collections of
                    lymphatic tissue. They are more prominent in children and, if enlarged, can obstruct air
                    passageways. Below the nasopharynx and closer to the mouth is the second division of the pharynx,
                    the <b>oropharynx</b> [6]. The <b>palatine tonsils</b> [7], two rounded masses of lymphatic tissue,
                    are in the oropharynx. The third division of the pharynx, the <b>laryngopharynx</b> [8], serves as a
                    common passageway for food from the mouth and air from the nose. It divides into the <b>larynx
                        (voice box)</b> [9] and the <b>esophagus</b> [10].</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0135">The esophagus leads into the stomach and carries food to be digested. The
                    larynx contains the vocal cords and is surrounded by pieces of cartilage for support and to keep

                    referred to as the Adam’s apple. As expelled air passes the vocal cords, they vibrate to produce
                    sounds. The tension of the vocal cords determines the high or low pitch of the voice.</div>

                    the pharynx, what prevents food or drink from entering the larynx and respiratory system during
                    swallowing? Even if a small quantity of solid or liquid matter finds its way into the air passages,
                    aspirated food can cause irritation in the lungs and breathing can stop. The <b>epiglottis</b> [11],
                    a flap of cartilage attached to the root of the tongue, prevents choking or aspiration of food. It
                    acts as a lid over the opening of the larynx. During swallowing, when food and liquid move through
                    the throat, the epiglottis closes over the larynx, preventing material from entering the lungs. <a

                <div class="text" id="p0145">On its way to the lungs, air passes through the larynx to the <b>trachea
                        (windpipe)</b> [12], a vertical tube about 4½ inches long and 1 inch in diameter. The trachea is
                    kept open by 16 to 20 C-shaped rings of cartilage separated by fibrous connective tissue; the rings
                    stiffen the front and sides of the tube.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0150">The <b>mediastinum</b> [13] is a space in the center of the chest. In the
                    region of the mediastinum, the trachea divides into two branches, the right and left <b>bronchial
                        tubes,</b> or <b>bronchi</b> [14] (<i>singular</i>: <b>bronchus</b>). The bronchi are tubes
                    composed of delicate epithelium surrounded by cartilage rings and a muscular wall. Each bronchus
                    leads to a separate <b>lung</b> [15], where it divides and subdivides into smaller and finer tubes,
                    somewhat like the branches of a tree.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0155">The small bronchial branches are the <b>bronchioles.</b> Each <b>terminal
                        bronchiole</b> [16] narrows into alveolar ducts, which end in collections of air sacs called
                    <b>alveoli</b> [17] (<i>singular</i>: <b>alveolus</b>). About 300 million alveoli are estimated to
                    be present in both lungs. The total area of the alveoli is approximately the size of a tennis court.
                    Each alveolus is lined with a one-cell-thick layer of epithelium. This very thin wall permits an
                    exchange of gases between the alveolus and the <b>capillary</b> [18] surrounding it. Blood flowing
                    through the capillary accepts oxygen from the alveolus while depositing carbon dioxide into the
                    alveolus. <b>Erythrocytes</b> [19] in the blood carry oxygen away from the lungs to all parts of the
                    body and carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0160">Each lung is covered by a double-layered membrane called the <b>pleura.</b>
                    The outer layer of this membrane, nearer the ribs, is the <b>parietal pleura</b> [20], and the inner
                    layer, closer to the lung, is the <b>visceral pleura</b> [21]. A serous (thin, watery fluid)
                    secretion moistens the pleura and facilitates movements of the lungs within the chest (thorax).
                </div>
                <div class="text" id="p0165">The two lungs are not quite mirror images of each other. The slightly
                    larger right lung is divided into three <b>lobes,</b> whereas the smaller left lung has two lobes.
                    One lobe of the lung can be removed without significantly compromising lung function. The uppermost
                    part of the lung is the <b>apex,</b> and the lower area is the <b>base.</b> The <b>hilum</b> of the
                    lung is the midline region in which blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic tissue, and bronchial tubes
                    enter and exit.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0170">The lungs extend from the collarbone to the <b>diaphragm</b> [22] in the
                    thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is a muscular partition separating the thoracic from the abdominal
                    cavity and aiding in the process of breathing. It contracts and descends with each <b>inhalation
                        (inspiration)</b> and relaxes and ascends with each <b>exhalation (expiration).</b> The downward
                    movement of the diaphragm enlarges the area in the thoracic cavity, decreasing internal air pressure
                    so that air flows into the lungs to equalize the pressure. When the lungs are full, the diaphragm
                    relaxes and elevates, making the area in the thoracic cavity smaller, <span role="doc-pagebreak"
                        epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="435" id="pagebreak_435" /><a id="pg435" />thus increasing air
                    pressure in the chest. Air then is expelled out of the lungs to equalize the pressure; this is

                                                the lung, and pneumoconiosis. Other causes of restrictive lung disease

                                                assessed by determining the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon

                                                bloodstream is measured. A common cause of reduced DLCO is emphysema due

                                    <div class="b1textfl" id="p0320">SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global
                                        pandemic and extreme public health crisis. As of Jan 2023, 676 million people
                                        have been affected worldwide and there have been 102 million cases in the United
                                        States.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0325">The term “long COVID syndrome” describes symptoms
                                        that persist after a minimum of 4 weeks from the onset of a diagnosed COVID-19
                                        infection. A recent study in the United States found that one third of people
                                        who had COVID-19 report persistent symptoms up to 9 months after the initial
                                        illness.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0330">Common symptoms are persistent fatigue, cough,
                                        dyspnea, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include chest pain,
                                        palpitations, paresthesias (abnormal sensations in hands and feet, memory loss,
                                        and brain fog.) Gastrointestinal dysfunction and rashes are reported as well.

                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0335">Treatment is aimed at symptom control, including
                                        respiratory therapy, breathing exercises, and medications such as propranolol
                                        (beta-blocker) to reduce persistent tachycardia. Inhalation therapeutic drugs
                                        are given to reduce bronchial inflammation. For some people with long COVID,
                                        symptoms resolve on their own within 3 months after onset of the initial
                                        illness. Many have reported that symptoms have diminished or even disappeared
                                        after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.</div>

                                    <div class="b1textfl" id="p0350">A 22-year-old man who was a known heroin abuser was
                                        admitted to an emergency department comatose, with shallow respirations. Routine
                                        laboratory studies and chest x-ray studies were done after the patient was
                                        aroused. He was then transferred to the ICU. He complained of left-sided chest
                                        pain. Examination of the chest film showed three fractured ribs on the right and
                                        a large right pleural effusion. Further questioning of a friend revealed that he
                                        had fallen and struck the corner of a table after injecting heroin.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="p0355">The diagnosis was traumatic hemothorax secondary to
                                        rib fractures, and a chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space. No
                                        blood could be obtained despite maneuvering of the tube. Another chest x-ray
                                        showed that the tube was correctly placed in the right pleural space, but the
                                        fractured ribs and pleural effusion were on the left. The radiologist then
                                        realized that he had reversed the first film. A second tube was inserted into
                                        the left pleural space, and 1500 mL [6 to 7 cups] of blood was evacuated.</div>

                                <div class="b1text" id="p0400">In 2008, Sarah Broom was a 35-year-old literature
                                    instructor and poet living in New Zealand. Married with two young sons, she was
                                    pregnant with her third child when she noticed shortness of breath accompanied by a
                                    persistent cough. An x-ray of her lungs during her seventh month of pregnancy showed
                                    a large mass in one lung. After a cesarean section (her daughter was born safely),
                                    she had a biopsy and other tests, which revealed NSCLC-advanced lung cancer. Sarah
                                    was a nonsmoker.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0405">The doctors in New Zealand told her that her care would
                                    be palliative and that she had only a few months to live.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0410">Sarah was desperate to explore other options. A friend in
                                    Boston connected her to the MGH Cancer Center, which conducted a genetic analysis of
                                    her lung biopsy material and discovered an unusual mutation, an EML 4-ALK
                                    translocation that had just been described in a published case from Japan. This same
                                    translocation is now known to account for about 3% of lung cancer, primarily in
                                    women and nonsmokers. Coincidentally, at this time, doctors at MGH happened to be
                                    testing a new drug, crizotinib, for an unrelated type of lung cancer, but the drug
                                    was able to block growth of EML 4-ALK cancers as well. Sarah was treated with
                                    crizotinib and experienced a remarkable 2-year remission. The tumor returned at that
                                    point, but a new drug, ceritinib proved effective for an additional 2 years.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p9820">The tumor recurred in 2013, resistant to all available
                                    drugs, and Sarah lost her battle. She had been with her young daughter through the
                                    first five years of the little girl’s childhood. In subsequent clinical trials,
                                    several new and more effective drugs targeted specifically against EML 4-ALK have
                                    been discovered. Targeted therapies, matching a specific drug to a tumor driven by a
                                    unique mutation, are now effective for many other kinds of cancers, including 10 or
                                    more individual types of lung cancer. Sarah Broom was a pioneer in showing the
                                    benefits of this kind of treatment.</div>
