                <div class="textfl" id="p0115"><b>Drugs</b> (medicines) are substances used to prevent or treat a
                    disease or condition. Some drugs are obtained from <b>plants,</b> such as from the roots, leaves, or
                    fruit. An example of a plant-derived drug is a cardiac medicine, digitalis (from the foxglove
                    plant). Other drugs (antibiotics such as penicillin) are derived from molds (fungi). Drugs also are
                    obtained from <b>animals.</b> For example, some pharmaceutical hormones are produced by the glands
                    of animals, and antivenoms are prepared from the venom of snakes, spiders, or other species with
                    poisonous bites or stings. The majority of drugs are <b>synthesized</b> (made) for commercial
                    purposes in a laboratory. <b>Vitamins</b> are drugs that occur naturally in plant or animal sources
                    and are contained in foods.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0120">A <b>pharmacist</b> prepares and dispenses drugs through a <b>pharmacy</b>
                    (drugstore) on a written order from a physician. The order is called a <b>prescription</b>.
                    Currently, most schools or colleges of pharmacy offer a PharmD (doctor of pharmacy) degree after 6
                    years of study. As a health care professional, a pharmacist cooperates with, consults with, and
                    sometimes advises licensed practitioners concerning drugs. In addition, the pharmacist answers
                    patients’ questions about their prescription. A <b>pharmacy technician</b> helps licensed
                    pharmacists provide medication and other health care products to patients.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0125"><b>Pharmacology</b> is the study of the discovery, properties, and uses of
                    drugs. A <b>pharmacologist</b> is either an MD (doctor of medicine) or a PhD (doctor of philosophy)
                    who specializes in the study of medicines. Pharmacology contains many subdivisions of study:
                    <b>medicinal chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, molecular pharmacology,
                        chemotherapy,</b> and <b>toxicology.</b></div>
                <div class="text" id="p0130"><b>Medicinal chemistry</b> is the study of new drug synthesis and the
                    relationship between chemical structure and biologic effects. <b>Pharmacodynamics</b> involves the
                    study of a drug’s effect on its target in the body. <b>Pharmacokinetics</b> is the study of a drug’s
                    absorption (how drugs pass into the bloodstream), distribution into body compartments, metabolism
                    (changes that drugs undergo within the body), and excretion (removal of the drug from the body) over
                    a period of time.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0135"><b>Molecular pharmacology</b> involves the interaction of drugs and
                    subcellular entities, such as DNA, RNA, and enzymes. It provides important information about the
                    mechanism of action of drugs.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0140"><b>Chemotherapy</b> is the study of drugs that destroy infectious
                    microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites, as well as cancerous cells.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0145"><b>Toxicology</b> is the study of the harmful effects of drugs and
                    chemicals on the body. Toxicologic studies are conducted in animals, as required by law, before new
                    drugs can be tested in humans. A toxicologist also is interested in finding proper <b>antidotes</b>
                    to any harmful effects of drugs. Antidotes are substances that prevent or reverse the unwanted
                    effects of drugs.</div>

                    <div class="text" id="p0160">The <b>generic name,</b> typically shorter and less complicated,

                        17 years of use by the original manufacturer, and any drug manufacturer may use it thereafter.
                        There is only one generic name for each drug.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0165">The <b>brand name</b> or trademark is the private property of the
                        individual drug manufacturer, and no competitor may use it. A brand name (also called trade
                        name) often has the superscript ® after or before the name, indicating that it is a registered
                        brand name. Drugs can have several brand names, because each manufacturer producing the drug
                        gives it a different name. When a specific brand name is ordered on a prescription by a
                        physician, it must be dispensed by the pharmacist; no other brand name may be substituted. It is
                        usual practice to capitalize the first letter of a brand name.</div>

                            bloodstream through the stomach or intestinal wall. This method is convenient for the
                            patient, but it has several disadvantages. If the drug is destroyed in the digestive tract
                            by digestive juices or if the drug is unable to pass through the intestinal wall, it will be
                            ineffective. Oral administration is also a disadvantage if a rapid onset of action is
                            desired. It takes several hours for oral medication to be fully absorbed into the
                            bloodstream.</li>

                                    This injection is made into a body cavity, such as the peritoneal or pleural cavity.
                                    For example, a drug such as bleomycin may be introduced into the pleural cavity in
                                    people who have pleural effusions due to malignant disease. The drug causes the
                                    pleural surfaces to adhere, thereby obliterating the pleural space and preventing
                                    the accumulation of fluid. This procedure is known as <b>pleurodesis.</b></li>

                                    superficial injection is made into the upper layers of the skin and is used chiefly
                                    in skin testing for allergic reactions.</li>
                                <li class="numlist1" id="p0230"><a id="o0135" />3. <b>Subcutaneous (hypodermic)
                                        injection (subQ).</b> A small hypodermic needle is introduced into the
                                    subcutaneous tissue under the skin, usually on the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. The
                                    drug then is absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin is injected daily via this
                                    route.</li>

                                    The buttock or upper arm is the usual site for this injection into muscle. This form
                                    of drug administration gives rapid absorption of single doses of drugs, but is
                                    inconvenient for continuous drug dosing.</li>

                                    instillation is into the space under the membranes (meninges) surrounding the spinal
                                    cord and brain. Methotrexate (a cancer chemotherapeutic drug) is introduced
                                    intrathecally for treatment of leukemia involving the spinal canal.</li>

                                    This injection is given directly into a vein. It is used when an immediate effect
                                    from the drug is desired or when the drug is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream
                                    after oral administration. Good technical skill is needed with intravenous
                                    injections because leakage of a drug into surrounding tissues may result in
                                    irritation and inflammation. Some medicines, such as anticancer drugs, are dissolved
                                    in a large volume of fluid and given by an intravenous infusion lasting several
                                    hours.</li>

                <div class="textfl" id="p0320">When a drug enters the body, it produces its effect by interacting with a
                    specific target, or <b>receptor</b>. A drug may cross the cell membrane to reach its intracellular
                    receptor or may react with a receptor on the cell’s surface. The <b>dose</b> of a drug is the amount
                    of drug administered, usually measured in milligrams or grams. The <b>schedule</b> is the exact
                    dose, timing, and frequency of drug administration.</div>

                            called additive. For example, if drug A gives 10% tumor kill as a chemotherapeutic agent and
                            drug B gives 20% tumor kill, using A and B together would give 30% tumor kill if they are

                            meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol). <b>Addiction</b> is the physical and psychologic
                            <b>dependence</b> on and craving for a drug and the presence of clearly unpleasant effects
                            when that drug or other agent such as a narcotic is stopped. <b>Controlled substances</b>
                            are drugs such as opioids or narcotics that produce dependence and have the potential for

                <div class="textfl" id="p0355">Drug toxicity is an unpleasant and potentially dangerous effect of a
                    drug. <b>Idiosyncrasy</b> is an example of an unpredictable type of drug toxicity. This is any
                    unexpected and uncommon side effect that develops after administration of a drug. For example, in
                    some people, penicillin causes an <b>idiosyncratic reaction,</b> such as <b>anaphylaxis</b> (acute
                    hypersensitivity with asthma and shock). Anaphylaxis occurs as a result of prior exposure and
                    sensitization to a drug or foreign substance (antigen).</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0360">Other types of drug toxicity are more predictable and expected, such as
                    stomach upset after aspirin use. Physicians are trained to be aware of the potential toxic effects
                    of all drugs that they prescribe. <b>Iatrogenic</b> (produced by treatment) disorders can occur,
                    however, as a result of mistakes in drug use or because of individual sensitivity to a given agent.
                </div>
                <div class="text" id="p0365"><b>Side effects</b> (also called <b>adverse reactions</b>) are unpleasant
                    effects that result from the use of a drug. They often occur with the usual therapeutic dosage of a
                    drug; side effects generally are tolerable, and they are reversible when the drug is discontinued.
                    For example, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia are common side effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs
                    used to treat cancer. Other rare side effects may be life-threatening, such as severe allergic
                    reactions.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0370"><b>Contraindications</b> are factors in a patient’s condition that make the
                    use of a particular drug dangerous and ill-advised. For example, in the presence of kidney failure,
                    it is unwise to administer a drug, such as methotrexate, that is normally eliminated by the kidneys
                    because excess drug will accumulate in the body and cause adverse effects.<span role="doc-pagebreak"

                    from an important mutation (genetic change) in the disease being treated (bacterial, viral, or

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0390">An <b>analgesic</b> (alges/o = sensitivity to pain) is a drug that
                        lessens pain. Mild analgesics relieve mild to moderate pain, such as myalgias, headaches, and
                        toothaches. More potent analgesics are <b>narcotics</b> or <b>opioids,</b> which are derived
                        from opium. These drugs may induce stupor (a condition of near-unconsciousness and reduced
                        mental and physical activity). They are used only to relieve severe pain because they may
                        produce dependence.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0395">Some nonnarcotic analgesics reduce fever, pain, and inflammation and
                        are used for joint disorders (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), painful menstruation,
                        and acute pain due to minor injuries or infection. These agents are not steroid hormones (such
                        as cortisone) and are known as <b>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</b> NSAIDs act
                        on tissues to inhibit prostaglandins (hormone-like substances that sensitize peripheral pain
                        receptors). A newer type of stronger NSAID is a COX-2 inhibitor. It relieves pain and
                        inflammation, as do traditional NSAIDs, but produces fewer gastrointestinal side effects.
                        Currently the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex) is used, but it carries an increased risk of
                        clot formation and heart attack. <a href="#t0020" id="Bt0020">Table 21-2</a> lists various types

                        sensation. This effect may occur in all tissues of the body <b>(general anesthetic)</b> and put
                        a patient asleep, or may be limited to a particular region <b>(local or regional
                            anesthetic).</b> General anesthetics are used for surgical procedures. They depress the
                        activity of the central nervous system, producing loss of consciousness, and block the
                        perception of pain. Local anesthetics inhibit the conduction of pain impulses in sensory nerves
                        in the region where they are injected or applied. Two examples are dental anesthesia with a
                        local Novocain injection or a nerve block for an orthopedic procedure.</div>

                                not effective against viruses, such as the flu virus. The use of antibiotics (penicillin
                                was the first in the 1940s, and now there are well over 100) has made it possible to
                                cure many conditions, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and streptococcal
                                pharyngitis (“strep throat”). Antibiotics are powerful drugs and, like all drugs, may
                                have dangerous side effects. Also, with indiscriminate use of antibiotics, bacteria can
                                develop resistance to a particular agent. Infections caused by these resistant bacteria
                                can spread and may be difficult or impossible to cure. Methicillin-resistant
                                <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> (C. difficile) are

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0715"><b>Anticoagulants</b> prevent clotting (coagulation) of blood. They
                        break up clots in blood vessels and treat conditions such as heart attack and stroke (CVA). They
                        also are used to prevent coagulation in preserved blood used for transfusions. <b>Heparin</b> is
                        a natural anticoagulant purified from pig intestine or bovine (cow) lung. A more easily
                        administered form of heparin called low-molecular-weight heparin (Fragmin, Lovenox) is
                        self-injected subcutaneously on a daily basis and requires no monitoring of blood clotting
                        ability, as may be required with regular heparin. Other anticoagulants, including <b>warfarin
                            (Coumadin),</b> are chemically synthesized. Warfarin’s effects must be monitored by taking
                        regular blood samples every two to three weeks to test prothrombin-INR time. The INR
                        (International Normalized Ratio) test measures blood clotting time and is kept in a safe range
                        of 2.0 to 3.0. <b>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)</b> dissolves clots and is used to
                        open vessels after myocardial infarction or stroke.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0720"><b>DOACs</b> are direct oral anticoagulant drugs that greatly reduce
                        the risk of stroke. Examples are apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), and rivaroxaban
                        (Xarelto). They routinely require no monitoring of blood coagulation status.</div>

                        together and initiate clots, particularly in arteries. Aspirin is an example of an antiplatelet
                        drug; daily aspirin prophylaxis may be recommended to prevent heart attacks (caused by clots in
                        the arteries of the heart). Clopidogrel (Plavix) inhibits clumping of platelets and is used to
                        prevent clotting after heart attacks and blood vessel procedures, such as angioplasty.</div>

                        normal brain function. Psychiatrists prescribe anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder (depressive
                        and manic episodes) and anxiety. Two anticonvulsant drugs are also commonly used for chronic
                        nerve pain resulting from injury, infection, or cancer. These are gabapentin (Neurontin) and
                        pregabalin (Lyrica). <a href="#t0030">Table 21-4</a> lists examples of anticonvulsants.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0975"><b>Antidiabetics</b> are used to treat diabetes mellitus (a condition
                        in which either the hormone insulin is not produced or the body’s tissues have developed
                        insensitivity to insulin). Patients with type 1 diabetes have lost the ability to produce
                        insulin as children or young adults and must receive daily injections of <b>insulin.</b> Human
                        insulin and synthetic derivations produced by recombinant DNA research have largely replaced
                        animal-derived insulin in the management of diabetes. Rapid-acting insulins peak at 30 to 60
                        minutes and last 3 to 5 hours. Short-acting insulins peak at 11⁄2 to 2 hours and last 6 to 8
                        hours. Intermediate-acting insulins peak at 4 to 12 hours and last 14 to 24 hours. Long-acting
                        insulins last up to 24 hours.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0980">Patients with type 2 diabetes usually develop the disease later in life
                        and have insensitivity to insulin. Their diabetes may be well controlled by limiting sugars in
                        their diet and by taking <b>oral antidiabetic drugs.</b> These include <b>sulfonylureas</b>
                        (lower the levels of glucose in the blood by stimulating the production of insulin),
                        <b>biguanides</b> (increase the body’s sensitivity to insulin and reduce the production of
                        glucose by the liver), <b>alpha-glucosidase inhibitors</b> (temporarily block enzymes that
                        digest sugars), <b>thiazolidinediones</b> (enhance glucose uptake into tissues), and
                        <b>meglitinides</b> (stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to produce insulin). <b>DPP4
                            inhibitors</b> work by stimulating cells to make more insulin when glucose levels are high.
                        <b>SGLT2 inhibitors</b> cause the body to excrete glucose in the urine. <b>Noninsulin injectable
                            medications</b> stimulate cells in the pancreas to make and release insulin. These last
                        longer in the bloodstream and are injected once a week.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0985">An <b>insulin pump</b> is a device strapped to the patient’s waist that
                        periodically delivers (through a subcutaneous needle inserted in the abdomen) the desired amount
                        of insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels. A device called a <b>bionic
                            pancreas</b> automatically monitors blood glucose levels and delivers tailored insulin doses
                        to patients with type 1 diabetes.</div>

                        potentially dangerous symptoms, rather than as cures for specific diseases. <b>Antacids</b>
                        neutralize the hydrochloric acid in the stomach to relieve symptoms of peptic ulcer,
                        esophagitis, and reflux. <b>Antiulcer</b> drugs block secretion of acid by cells in the lining
                        of the stomach and are prescribed for patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers and
                        <b>gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</b> Histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers such as
                        <b>cimetidine (Tagamet)</b> turn off histamine, which promotes secretion of stomach acid.
                        Another drug, <b>omeprazole (Prilosec),</b> works by stopping acid production by a different
                        method (proton pump inhibition).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p1430"><b>Antidiarrheal</b> drugs relieve diarrhea and decrease the rapid
                        movement (peristalsis) in the muscular walls of the colon. <b>Cathartics</b> relieve
                        constipation and promote defecation for diagnostic and operative procedures and are used to
                        treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Some cathartics increase the intestinal salt
                        content to cause fluid to fill the intestines; others increase the bulk of the feces to promote
                        peristalsis. Another type of cathartic lubricates the intestinal tract to produce soft stools.
                        <b>Laxatives</b> are mild cathartics, and <b>purgatives</b> are strong cathartics.</div>

                        overcome vertigo, dizziness, motion sickness, and similar symptoms due to labyrinthitis

                    <div class="textfl" id="p1755">Stimulants are drugs that act on the brain to speed up vital
                        processes (heart and respiration) in cases of shock and collapse. They also increase alertness
                        and inhibit hyperactive behavior in children. High doses can produce restlessness, insomnia, and
                        hypertension. Examples of stimulants are <b>amphetamines</b>—used to prevent narcolepsy
                        (seizures of sleep), to suppress appetite, and to calm hyperkinetic children. <b>Caffeine</b>
                        also is a cerebral stimulant. It is used in drugs to relieve certain types of headache by
                        constricting cerebral blood vessels. <a href="#t0060">Table 21-11</a> lists examples of
