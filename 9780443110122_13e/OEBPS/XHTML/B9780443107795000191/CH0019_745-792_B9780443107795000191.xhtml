                <div class="textfl" id="p0280">Cancer is a disease caused by abnormal and excessive growth of cells in
                    the body. It may arise in any tissue and appear at any time of life, although cancer occurs most
                    frequently in older people. Cancer cells accumulate as growths called malignant tumors that
                    compress, invade, and ultimately destroy the surrounding normal tissue. In addition to their local
                    growth, cancerous cells spread throughout the body by way of the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels.
                    In some patients, the spread of cancers from their site of origin to distant organs occurs early in
                    the course of tumor growth and ultimately results in death.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0285">Although nearly two thirds of all patients who develop cancer are cured of
                    their disease, about 600,000 people die of cancer in the United States each year. Lung cancers,
                    followed by breast and colorectal cancers, are the most common causes of cancer death for women,
                    whereas lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers are the leading causes of death due to cancer in men.
                    This chapter explores the terminology related to this common and often fatal group of diseases.

                <h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Characteristics of Tumors</h2>
                <div class="textfl" id="p0290"><b>Tumors (neoplasms)</b> are new growths that arise from normal tissue.
                    They may be either <b>malignant</b> (capable of invasion and spread to surrounding or more distant
                    sites) or <b>benign</b> (noninvasive and not spreading to other sites). There are several
                    differences between benign and malignant tumors. Some of these differences are:</div>
                <div>
                    <ul class="ce_list" id="olist0015">
                        <li class="numlist" id="p0295"><a id="o0030" />1. Benign tumors <b>grow slowly,</b> and
                            malignant tumor cells <b>multiply rapidly.</b></li>
                        <li class="numlist" id="p0300"><a id="o0035" />2. Benign tumors are often <b>encapsulated</b>
                            (contained within a fibrous capsule or cover) so that the tumor cells do not invade the
                            surrounding tissue. Malignant tumors characteristically are <b>invasive</b> and
                            <b>infiltrative,</b> extending into neighboring normal tissue.</li>
                        <li class="numlist" id="p0305"><a id="o0040" />3. Benign tumors are composed of organized and
                            specialized <b>(differentiated)</b> cells that closely resemble the normal, mature tissue
                            from which they are derived. For example, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak"
                                aria-label="747" id="pagebreak_747" /><a id="pg747" />benign tumors derived from
                            epithelial cells that line the wall of the gastrointestinal tract look very much like their
                            normal counterparts. Malignant tumors are composed of cancerous cells that resemble
                            primitive cells and lack the capacity to perform mature cell functions. This characteristic
                            of malignant tumors is called <b>anaplasia.</b> Anaplasia (ana- means backward and -plasia
                            means growth) indicates that the cancerous cells are <b>dedifferentiated,</b> or
                            <b>undifferentiated</b> (reverting to a less specialized state), in contrast with the
                            normal, differentiated tissue of their origin. Anaplastic cells lack an orderly arrangement.
                            Thus, tumor cells vary in size and shape and are piled one on top of the other in a
                            disorganized fashion. The nuclei in these cells are large and <b>hyperchromatic</b> (stain
                            excessively with dyes that recognize genetic material, DNA).</li>

                        <b>(carcinogenesis)</b> are only partly understood. What is clear is that malignant
                        transformation results from damage to the genetic material, or <b>DNA (deoxyribonucleic
                            acid),</b> of the cell. Strands of DNA in the cell nucleus form <b>chromosomes,</b> which
                        become readily visible under a microscope when a cell is preparing to divide into two (daughter)
                        cells. In order to understand what causes cancer, it is necessary to learn more about DNA and
                        its functions in a normal cell.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0330">DNA has two main functions in a normal cell. First, DNA controls the
                        production of new cells (cell division). When a cell divides, the DNA material in each
                        chromosome copies itself so that exactly the same DNA is passed to the two new daughter cells
                        that are formed. This process of cell division is called <b>mitosis</b> (<a href="#f0025"
                            id="Bf0025">Figure 19-4A</a>).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0335">Second, DNA controls the production of new proteins (<b>protein
                            synthesis</b>) in the cell. Each DNA piece, or <b>gene</b>, contains the code for making a
                        single protein. That protein carries out an important specific function in the cell. There are
                        20,000 to 25,000 human protein-coding genes. Genes are composed of an arrangement of units
                        called <b>nucleotides</b> (containing a sugar, phosphate, and a base, such as adenine, guanine,
                        thymine, or cytosine). DNA (as a string of coded nucleotides) sends a molecular message outside
                        the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell, directing the synthesis of specific proteins (such as
                        hormones and enzymes) essential for normal cell function and growth. This message is transmitted
                        in the following way: In the nucleus, the coded message with instructions for making a specific
                        protein is copied from DNA onto another molecule called <b>RNA (ribonucleic acid).</b> Then RNA
                        travels from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell, carrying the coded message that directs
                        the formation of specific proteins (<a href="#f0025">Figure 19-4B</a>).<span

                        protein synthesis are disturbed. Cancer cells reproduce almost continuously, and abnormal
                        proteins are made. Malignant cells are <b>anaplastic</b>; that is, their DNA stops making normal
                        codes that allow the cells to carry on the function of differentiating mature cells. Instead,
                        new signals lead to malignant growth and spread of tumor cells.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0345">Various kinds of damage to DNA result in malignancy. DNA damage may be
                        caused by toxic chemicals, sunlight, tobacco smoke, and viruses. The specific damage usually
                        involves changes in the cell’s DNA codes, creating abnormal genes with changes called
                        <b>mutations</b>. Mutations interfere with the accurate synthesis of new proteins and can be
                        passed on to new cells during cell division.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0350">Although most DNA changes, or mutations, lead to higher-than-normal
                        rates of growth, some mutations found in cancer cells actually prevent the cells from dying. In
                        recent years, scientists have recognized that in some types of cancers, the normal blueprints
                        that direct aging or damaged cells to die are missing. Normal cells undergo spontaneous
                        disintegration by a process known as <b>apoptosis,</b> or programmed cell death. Some cancer
                        cells have lost elements of this program and thus can live indefinitely.</div>

                        to x-rays. There is a high incidence of leukemia and other cancers among survivors of atomic
                        bomb explosions, as at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight can cause skin

                        <b>translocation.</b> What happens is that the gene <i>abl</i> on chromosome 9 moves to a new
                        location next to a gene called <i>bcr</i> on chromosome 22, (see <a href="#f0030"
                            id="Bf0030">Figure 19-5</a>). When <b>bcr</b> (<b>b</b>reakpoint <b>c</b>luster
                        <b>r</b>egion) and <b>abl</b> are near each other, they cause the production of an abnormal
                        protein that makes the leukocyte divide and causes a malignancy (chronic myeloid leukemia). The
                        new chromosome formed from the translocation is called the <b>Philadelphia chromosome</b> (it
                        was discovered in 1970 in Philadelphia). Other gene translocations are found in lung cancers.

                        division and leads to cancer. Examples of suppressor genes are the <b>retinoblastoma (Rb) type 1
                            gene <i>(RB1)</i></b> and the <i><b>TP53</b></i> gene, which leads to brain tumors or breast

                        carcinomas. They derive from connective tissues in the body, such as bone, fat, muscle,
                        cartilage, and bone marrow and from cells of the lymphatic system. Often, the term
                        <b>mesenchymal tissue</b> is used to describe embryonic connective tissue from which sarcomas
                        are derived. The middle, or mesodermal, layer of the embryo gives rise to the connective tissues
                        of the body as well as to blood and lymphatic vessels.</div>

                        types of sarcomas and the connective tissues from which they derive. Benign tumors of connective
                        tissue origin are named by adding the suffix <b>-oma</b> to the type of tissue in which the
                        tumor occurs. For example, a benign tumor of bone is called an <b>osteoma.</b> Malignant tumors
                        of connective tissue origin are frequently named using the term <b>sarcoma</b> (<b>sarc/o</b> =
                        flesh). For example, an <b>osteosarcoma</b> is a malignant tumor of bone.<span

                        microscopic appearance of the tumor cells, specifically with their degree of maturity and
                        differentiation. Often, three or four grades are used. <b>Grade I</b> tumors are very well
                        differentiated, so that they closely resemble normal cells. <b>Grade IV</b> tumors are so
                        undifferentiated or anaplastic that even recognition of the tumor’s tissue of origin may be
                        difficult. <b>Grades II</b> and <b>III</b> are intermediate in appearance, moderately or poorly
                        differentiated, as opposed to well differentiated (grade I) and undifferentiated (grade IV).

                        and IV tumors have an increasingly poorer survival rate. Grading also is used in evaluating

                        (drugs). It is the standard treatment for many types of cancer, and is curative in a number of
                        them, such as testicular cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia (children), and Hodgkin lymphoma,
                        and large cell lymphomas. Chemotherapy may be used alone or in combination with surgery and
                        irradiation to improve cure rates.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0535">Drugs cause tumor cells to die by damaging their DNA. Tumor cells with
                        damaged DNA undergo apoptosis (self-destruction). This means that they have less capacity to
                        repair their DNA and, in general, are less able to survive DNA damage caused by drugs and
                        radiation.</div>

                                create chemical bonds with DNA, leading to crosslinks and breaks in DNA. These breaks
                                interfere with cell division. <b>Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)</b> is an example.</li>

                                drugs are derived from bacteria, fungi or plants, or from small sea animals found on

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0590">Immunotherapy is the use of immune cells (lymphocytes) or antibodies
                        to kill tumors. It is now possible to remove a patient’s own T cell lymphocytes and, in the
                        laboratory, introduce new receptors, <b>CARs (chimeric antigen receptors),</b> on their cell
                        surface. These CAR receptors are designed to bind to the CD19 protein found on the surface of
                        all B-cell tumors. The engineered <b>CAR-T cells</b> can then be infused into the patient, where
                        they attack and destroy B-cell tumors, including acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphoid
                        leukemia (CLL), and lymphomas.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0595">Other immunotherapies depend on laboratory engineered antibodies,
                        called <b>monoclonal antibodies</b>. These monoclonal antibodies can kill tumors by blocking
                        growth receptors on their cell surface. One of the most effective of these therapeutic
                        antibodies is <b>Herceptin,</b> which inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells. Herceptin
                        blocks HER2 growth receptors on breast cancer cells. Thus, if a patient presents with a HER2
                        breast cancer, the patient’s tumor will respond to treatment with Herceptin.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0600">A new way of using monoclonal antibodies is to attach a potent (toxic)
                        drug to the antibody. The antibody will carry the drug specifically to tumor cells and release
                        the toxic drug at that site, sparing normal tissue. These drugs are <b>antibody drug conjugates
                            (ADCs).</b></div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0605">In another example of immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies are used to
                        activate T cell lymphocytes. Normal T cell lymphocytes are capable of recognizing and killing
                        tumor cells, but in most cancer patients this response is ineffective due to a built-in brake
                        called a checkpoint on the T cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies can block this checkpoint brake
                        and allow the normal T cell population to expand and destroy the tumor. These antibodies, called
                        <b>checkpoint inhibitors,</b> can treat melanoma, lymphoma, and lung, kidney, bladder, and colon
                        cancers. See <a href="#t0045" id="Bt0045">Table 19-8</a> for examples of monoclonal antibodies

                                    experienced radiation therapy for breast cancer.</i></div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0200">My life changed forever when I got that phone call that no
                                one wants to hear: “Your biopsy is malignant.” So after they tell you that you have
                                cancer, you are scared to death, begin to contemplate your mortality, and wonder how to
                                break the news to your husband, children, loved ones, and friends. You settle down and
                                marshal up your strength to fight this beast that attacks too many of us.</div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0205">After my biopsy, I met with a team that included my
                                surgeon, my radiation oncologist, and my medical oncologist. It was decided that the
                                best course of action was to perform a lumpectomy to remove the malignant tissue in my
                                breast. At the same time, I would also have a sentinel node biopsy to check for
                                lymphatic invasion. Surgery would be followed by a course of radiation therapy and then
                                a 5-year regimen of the drug tamoxifen.</div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0210">Approximately 3 weeks after the surgery, I met with my
                                radiation oncologist. She explained all the benefits and risks associated with
                                radiation. At my first radiotherapy appointment, technicians created a mold to hold my
                                breast in the exact position for treatment. I was marked on both sides of my body with
                                indelible ink to place the mold correctly each visit. I also received a small permanent
                                tattoo on the middle of my breastbone that enabled the machine to correctly target the
                                beams.</div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0215">On my first day of treatment, as I walked into the
                                radiation room, I noticed hundreds of molds for other patients stacked up against the
                                wall. The technicians positioned me into my mold and calibrated the machine against the
                                markings on my body. When all the bodily GPS settings were in sync, they scurried out of
                                the room to stand behind the giant lead walls (the cowards). A giant circular radiation
                                machine began to move closer, gyrating slowly back and forth until it was properly
                                fixed. A pulse of light shot out and a humming sound began. The machine gradually
                                rotated, sending radiation to my breast. The entire treatment session lasted less than
                                10 minutes.</div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0220">My side effects of radiation included fatigue and skin
                                irritation from folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles). Even after my treatments
                                ended, side effects (blisters and even bleeding) continued. Time, however, brought
                                healing.</div>
                            <div class="b1text" id="bpar0225">I am amazed at what my journey revealed. Most of all, it
                                taught me about how wonderful friends can be, how much of a difference support groups
                                can make, and why dedicated medical professionals deserve so much thanks and praise. A
                                very lovely woman I met along the way shared some wisdom that I will pass along to all
                                of you reading my story. She said, “At first cancer is your whole world, then it becomes
                                a room, then it becomes a drawer in that room, and then it becomes a box in the drawer.”
                                I still take that box out once in a while, but not as often.</div>

                                    physician with a painless mass in her left breast. During breast examination a
                                    1.0-cm, firm, nontender mass was palpated in the upper outer quadrant located at the
                                    2 o’clock position, 3 cm from the areola. The mass was not fixed to the skin, and
                                    there was no cutaneous erythema or edema. No axillary or supraclavicular
                                    lymphadenopathy was noted.</div>

                                    pathology report described a gross specimen of fatty breast tissue. Microscopic
                                    evaluation of the nodule revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma. The margins of the
                                    lumpectomy specimen were free of tumor. Sentinel node [first lymph node where cancer
                                    cells are likely to spread] biopsy revealed no tumor involvement.</div>

                                    bone scan; all results were negative.</div>

                                            hard, nontender mass in his right testicle. He goes to his doctor, who
                                            checks his serum human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels
                                            and finds both to be quite elevated. The tentative diagnosis is a germ cell
                                            tumor of the testis. A CT scan of the abdomen reveals extensive
                                            lymphadenopathy along the aorta. A chest CT shows nodes in both lungs
                                            suggestive of tumor. An orchiectomy confirms the diagnosis of testicular
                                            cancer. He is given four cycles of chemotherapy with vinblastine, cisplatin,
                                            and bleomycin, and his serum AFP and HCG markers return to normal. His CT
                                            scans reveal no evidence of residual tumor.</li>

                                            notices repeated episodes of red blood in her stool with each bowel
                                            movement. A colonoscopy reveals a 4-cm mass arising from the wall of the
                                            rectum. A biopsy demonstrates a rectal adenocarcinoma. An abdominal CT shows
                                            two large metastases in the liver and enlarged lymph nodes. She first
                                            receives four cycles of 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, which cause the
                                            liver lesions to shrink significantly and the lymph nodes to regress. The
                                            remaining liver lesions are surgically resected. Radiation therapy is then
                                            administered to shrink the rectal tumor and lymph nodes. A small residual
                                            tumor is resected. The lymph nodes are removed and contain no tumor.</li>

                                            routine PSA blood sample drawn. PSA is elevated at 5.8 (normal is less than
                                            4.0). A transrectal biopsy of the prostate reveals a Gleason grade 6
                                            adenocarcinoma in 4 of 12 biopsy pieces. He chooses to be treated with
                                            brachytherapy. Treatment causes dysuria, cystitis, and proctitis, but these
                                            symptoms disappear 6 weeks after therapy ends, and his PSA is now
