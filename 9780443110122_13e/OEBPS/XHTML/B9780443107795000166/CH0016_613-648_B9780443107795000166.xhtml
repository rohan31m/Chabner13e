                <h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Introduction</h2>
                <div class="textfl" id="p0140">The skin and its accessory structures (hair, nails, and glands) make up
                    the <b>integumentary system</b> of the body. Integument means covering, and the skin (weighing 8 to
                    10 pounds and extending over an area of 22 square feet in an average adult) is the outer covering
                    for the body. It is, however, more than a simple body covering. This complex system of specialized
                    tissues contains glands that secrete several types of fluids, nerves that carry impulses, and blood
                    vessels that aid in the regulation of the body temperature.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0145">The skin has many important functions:</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0150">First, as a protective membrane over the entire body, the skin guards the
                    deeper tissues of the body against excessive loss of water, salts, and heat and against invasion of
                    pathogens and their toxins. Specialized cells (Langerhans cells) react to the presence of antigens
                    and have an immune function.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0155">Second, the skin contains two types of glands that produce important
                    secretions. These glands in the skin are the <b>sebaceous glands</b> and the <b>sweat glands.</b>
                    Sebaceous glands produce <b>sebum,</b> an oily secretion, and sweat glands produce <b>sweat,</b> a
                    watery secretion. Sebum and sweat pass to the outer edges of the skin through ducts and leave the
                    skin through pores (openings). Sebum lubricates the surface of the skin, and sweat cools the body as
                    it evaporates from the skin surface.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0160">Third, nerve fibers under the skin are receptors for sensations such as
                    pain, temperature, pressure, and touch. Thus, the body’s adjustment to the environment depends on
                    sensory messages relayed to the brain and spinal cord by sensitive nerve endings in the skin.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0165">Fourth, different tissues in the skin maintain body temperature
                    (thermoregulation). Nerve fibers coordinate thermoregulation by carrying messages to the skin from
                    heat centers in the brain that are sensitive to increases and decreases in body temperature.
                    Impulses from these fibers cause blood vessels to dilate to bring blood to the surface and cause
                    sweat glands to produce the watery secretion that carries heat away.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0190">The epidermis is the outermost totally cellular layer of the skin. It
                        is composed of <b>squamous epithelium.</b> Epithelium is the covering of both the internal and
                        the external surfaces of the body. Squamous epithelial cells are flat and scale-like. In the
                        outer layer of the skin, these cells are arranged in several layers <b>(strata)</b> to form
                        <b>stratified squamous epithelium.</b></div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0195">The epidermis lacks blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and connective
                        tissue (elastic fibers, cartilage, fat) and is therefore dependent on the deeper dermis layer
                        and its rich network of capillaries for nourishment. In fact, oxygen and nutrients seep out of
                        the capillaries in the dermis, pass through tissue fluid, and supply nourishment to the lower
                        layers of the epidermis.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0200"><a href="#f0010">Figure 16-1B</a> illustrates the multilayered cells of
                        the epidermis. The deepest layer is called the <b>basal layer</b> [4]. The cells in the basal
                        layer are constantly growing and multiplying and are the source of all the other cells in the
                        epidermis. As the basal layer <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="615"
                            id="pagebreak_615" /><a id="pg615" />cells divide, they are pushed upward and away from the
                        blood supply of the dermal layer by a steady stream of younger cells. In their movement toward
                        the most superficial layer of the epidermis, called the <b>stratum corneum</b> [5], cells
                        flatten, shrink, lose their nuclei, and die, becoming filled with a hard protein material called
                        <b>keratin.</b> These cells are called keratinocytes. Finally, within 3 to 4 weeks after
                        beginning as a basal cell in the deepest part of the epidermis, the keratinized cell is sloughed
                        off from the surface of the skin. The epidermis is thus constantly renewing itself, with cells
                        dying at the same rate at which they are replaced. This process slows with age.</div>

                        amount of melanin within each cell accounts for the color differences among the races.
                        Individuals with darker skin possess more melanin within the melanocytes, not a greater number
                        of melanocytes. Individuals who are incapable of forming melanin have a condition called
                        <b>albinism</b>, in which the skin and hair are white. In albinism, eye color varies, ranging
                        from red to blue to brown, depending on the amount of melanin present in the iris (pigmented

                        and this creates a suntan, which is a protective response. When the melanin cannot absorb all of
                        the ultraviolet rays, the skin becomes sunburned and inflamed (redness, swelling, and pain).
                        Over a period of years, excessive exposure to sun tends to cause wrinkles, permanent pigmentary
                        changes, and even cancer of the skin. People who have more melanin tend to acquire fewer
                        wrinkles and are less at risk for developing the types of skin cancer that are associated with
                        ultraviolet light exposure.</div>

                        vessels and lymph and nerve fibers, as well as the accessory organs of the skin, which are the
                        hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. To support the elaborate system of nerves,
                        vessels, and glands, the dermis contains connective tissue cells and fibers that account for the
                        extensibility and elasticity of the skin.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0220">The dermis is composed of interwoven <b>elastin</b> (protein that is
                        elastic and helps skin to return to its original position when pinched or poked) and
                        <b>collagen</b> fibers. Collagen (<b>colla</b> = glue) is a fibrous protein material found in
                        bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as in the skin. It is tough and resistant but
                        also flexible. In the infant, collagen is loose and delicate; it becomes harder as the body
                        ages. During pregnancy, overstretching of the skin with weight gain may break the elastin
                        fibers, resulting in linear markings called <b>striae</b> (“stretch marks”) on the woman’s
                        abdomen and elsewhere. Collagen fibers support and protect the blood and nerve networks that
                        pass through the dermis.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0245">Nails are hard keratin plates covering the dorsal surface of the last
                        bone of each toe and finger. They are composed of keratinocytes that are cemented together
                        tightly and can extend indefinitely unless cut or broken. A nail grows in thickness and length
                        as a result of division of cells in the region of the nail matrix, which is at the base
                        (proximal portion) of the nail plate.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0250">Fingernails grow about 1 mm per week, which means that they can regrow
                        in 3 to 5 months. Toenails grow more slowly than fingernails; it takes approximately 12 months
                        for toenails to be replaced completely.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0255">The <b>lunula</b> is a semilunar (half-moon–shaped) whitish region at
                        the base of the nail plate. It generally can be seen in the thumbnail of most people and is
                        evident to varying degrees in other fingernails. Air mixed in with keratin and cells rich in
                        nuclei give the lunula its whitish color. The <b>cuticle,</b> a narrow band of epidermis (layer
                        of keratin), is at the base and sides of the nail plate. The <b>paronychium</b> is the soft
                        tissue surrounding the nail border. <a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 16-3A</a> illustrates

                                glands</b>) are tiny, coiled glands found on almost all body surfaces (about 2 million
                            in the body). They are most numerous in the palm of the hand (3000 glands per square inch)
                            and in the sole of the foot. As illustrated in <a href="#f0025">Figure 16-4</a>, the coiled
                            eccrine sweat gland originates deep in the dermis and straightens out to extend up through
                            the epidermis. The tiny opening on the surface is a <b>pore.</b></div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0275">Sweat, or perspiration, is almost pure water, with dissolved
                            materials such as salt making up less than 1% of the total composition. It is colorless and
                            odorless. The odor produced when sweat accumulates on the skin is caused by the action of
                            bacteria on the sweat.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0280">Sweat cools the body as it evaporates into the air. Perspiration is
                            controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, whose nerve fibers are activated by the heart

                            an odorless sweat, containing substances easily broken down by bacteria on the skin. The

                                <div class="b1text" id="bpar0100">Mr. Murphy noticed a hard mass on his right buttocks.
                                    He consulted his doctor, who recommended a biopsy, which was initially read as a
                                    poorly differentiated soft tissue sarcoma metastatic to lung and bone. Seeking
                                    further advice, he came to an East Coast cancer center, where the pathology reading
                                    was changed to a malignant melanoma, a skin tumor that rarely responds to
                                    conventional chemotherapy. Eight years earlier he had a “dysplastic nevus” removed
                                    from his shoulder. A rereading of that material confirmed that the earlier lesion
                                    was in fact a melanoma, undoubtedly the source of his new lesions. He was fortunate
                                    that genomic analysis revealed that his tumor contained a mutation in the B-RAF
                                    oncogene, indicating that it would be sensitive to a new “targeted” drug, specific
                                    for his kind of B-RAF mutant tumor.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="bpar0105">With that experimental treatment, he experienced a
                                    5-year complete remission. At that point, after stopping his drugs, he quickly had a
                                    recurrence of tumor in the form of multiple small lesions in the brain; these were
                                    treated with radiation therapy. New tumors were found growing along his spinal cord,
                                    indicating that his tumor was no longer responsive to the B-RAF inhibitor. However,
                                    the spinal metastases responded to treatment with a new immunotherapy, an anti-PD-1
                                    antibody. The antibody caused an autoimmune reaction, a severe colitis, which was
                                    controlled with other medication. He is now more than 8 years from his original
                                    diagnosis, biking and hiking and free of symptoms, with no signs of active disease.

                                    lesions, lungs, ilium” and “Not that long before it will take you …” put me in
                                    denial and fear and lonesome turning into forsaken. But I had two things going for
                                    me—my college sweetheart wife, Mary, who said right off, “You can’t die on me,” and
                                    my brother, Marty, who guided my course to a second opinion at an East Coast cancer
                                    center.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="bpar0120">After a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, I became a
                                    cohort in the first human trial of targeted drug therapy for my B-RAF mutated tumor.
                                    After 5 years of a wonderful life, sprinkled with occasions of great unpleasantness
                                    from feverous side effects, the drug trial concluded, and I soon discovered that
                                    cancer was now in my brain. After zapping the lesions with SRS (stereotactic
                                    radiosurgery), doctors would have to attack and kill leptomeningeal brain and spine
                                    cancer. They switched me to immunotherapy, and that’s where I remain. I learned
                                    firsthand about colitis, a side effect of immunotherapy, but happily, doctors were
                                    able to get my bowels put back right to boot. Now, it’s just the occasional knife
                                    fight with the cancerous “escaped lesions” in my abdomen and leg, but my
                                    immunotherapy drug, Opdivo, continues to work.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="bpar0125">Along the way, in the hard times, I realized that it
                                    takes courage to look for Hope, but if you look hard you will surely find some hope,
                                    and it will help you prolong your life. I think we need Gratitude too. Cancer is an
                                    intolerable menace that plagues so many across the globe. Science has fought back
                                    with lifesaving drugs. I’m a beneficiary. Finally we need Vigilance. I’m still
                                    motivated to fight that fierce wolf, the cancer that first came tearing into me.
                                    It’s still there, limping along with the mange, a notched ear, and an eye that
                                    doesn’t seem to open. Ultimately, I find my greatest source of strength is to be in
                                    love with a woman who looks you in the eye and says, “You can’t die on me!”</div>
