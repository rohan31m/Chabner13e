                <div class="textfl" id="p0380">You will find this chapter different from others in the book. Many
                    psychiatric disorders are not readily explainable in terms of abnormalities in the structure or
                    chemistry of an organ or tissue, as are other illnesses. In addition, the causes of mental disorders
                    are complex and include significant psychological and social as well as chemical and structural
                    elements. This chapter provides a simple outline of psychiatric disorders and definitions of major
                    psychiatric terms. For more extensive and detailed information, consult the <b><i>Diagnostic and
                            Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,</i> fifth edition, (DSM-5-TR)</b> published by the
                    American Psychiatric Association.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0385"><b>Psychiatry</b> (<b>psych/o</b> = mind, <b>iatr/o</b> = treatment) is the
                    branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illness. It is
                    a specialty of clinical medicine like surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0390"><b>Psychiatrists</b> complete the same medical training (4 years of medical
                    school) as other physicians and receive an MD (doctor of medicine) or OD (doctor of osteopathy)
                    degree. Then they spend a variable number of years training in the methods and practice of
                    <b>psychotherapy</b> (psychological techniques for treating mental disorders) and
                    <b>psychopharmacology</b> (drug therapy). Psychiatrists complete 3 years of residency training and
                    then extra years of fellowship training to specialize in various aspects of psychiatry. <b>Child
                        psychiatrists</b> specialize in the treatment of children; <b>forensic psychiatrists</b>
                    specialize in the legal aspects of psychiatry, such as the determination of mental competence in
                    criminal cases. <b>Psychoanalysts</b> complete 3 to 5 additional years of training in a special
                    psychotherapeutic technique called <b>psychoanalysis</b> in which the patient freely relates her or
                    his thoughts and associations to the analyst, who does not interfere with the process.
                    Interpretations are offered at appropriate times.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0395">A <b>psychologist</b> is a nonmedical professional who is trained in
                    methods of psychological testing, psychotherapy, and research. Psychologists complete a doctor of
                    philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of psychology (PsyD) degree program in a specific field of interest,
                    such as <b>clinical psychology</b> (patient-oriented) <b>experimental research,</b> or <b>social
                        psychology</b> (focusing on social interaction and the ways the actions of others influence the
                    behavior of the individual). A <b>clinical psychologist,</b> like a psychiatrist, can use various
                    methods of psychotherapy to treat patients and in some states can prescribe drugs for treatment.
                    Other nonphysicians trained in the treatment of mental illness include licensed clinical social
                    workers, psychiatric nurses, and licensed mental health clinicians (LMHCs).</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0400">Clinical psychologists are trained in the use of tests to evaluate various
                    aspects of a patient’s mental health and intelligence. Examples are <b>intelligence (IQ) tests</b>
                    such as the <b>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)</b> and the <b>Stanford-Binet Intelligence
                        Scale.</b> Two <b>projective personality tests</b> are the <b>Rorschach technique,</b> in which
                    inkblots, as shown in <a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 22-1</a>, are used to bring out
                    associations, and the <b>Thematic Apperception Test (TAT),</b> in which pictures are used as stimuli
                    for making up stories (<a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 22-2</a>). Examples of <b>graphomotor
                        projection tests</b> are the <b>Draw a Person Test,</b> in which the patient is asked to copy a
                    body, and the <b>Bender-Gestalt Test,</b> in which the patient is asked to draw certain geometric
                    designs. The Bender-Gestalt Test picks up deficits in mental processing and memory caused by brain
                    damage and is used to screen children for developmental delays. The <b>Minnesota Multiphasic
                        Personality Inventory (MMPI)</b> contains true-false questions that reveal aspects of
                    personality, such as sense of duty or responsibility, ability to relate to others, and dominance
                    (assertiveness, resourcefulness). This test is widely used as a measure of psychological health in
                    adolescents and adults. The patient’s responses to questions are compared with responses made by
                    patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, depression, and other mental disorders.<span

                <div class="textfl" id="p0410">Sigmund Freud’s ideas of personality structure play an important role in
                    the understanding of many types of psychiatric disorders. Freud believed that personality is made up
                    of three major parts: the <b>id,</b> the <b>ego,</b> and the <b>superego.</b> The <b>id</b>
                    represents unconscious instincts and psychic energy present from birth. The id contains basic drives
                    that seek immediate gratification regardless of the reality of the situation.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0415">The <b>ego</b> is the central coordinating branch of the personality. It is
                    the mediator between the id and the outside world. It is the part of the personality that evaluates
                    and assesses the reality of a situation <b>(reality testing)</b> and, if necessary, postpones the
                    gratification of a need or drive (id) until a satisfactory object or appropriate situation arises.
                    The ego is perceived as being “self” by the individual.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0420">The <b>superego</b> is the internalized conscience and moral part of the
                    personality. It encompasses the sense of discipline derived from parental authority and society.
                    Guilt feelings, for example, arise from behavior and thoughts that do not conform to the standards
                    of the superego.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0425">Freud believed that certain psychological disorders occur when conflicts
                    arise between two or more of these aspects of the personality. <b>Defense mechanisms,</b> such as
                    repression and denial, are techniques people use to ward off the anxiety produced by these
                    conflicts. For example, a person afflicted with a serious illness may avoid confronting their
                    present or future problems by denial. Thus, they may refuse to believe the diagnosis, may miss
                    appointments, may neglect medication, or may ignore symptoms. All people use defense mechanisms to
                    cope with difficult problems. The use of these mechanisms may be regarded as abnormal or normal
                    according to whether that use makes a constructive or destructive contribution to the individual’s
                    personality.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="865"

                <div class="text" id="p0430">The term <b>psychosis</b> frequently is used to describe abnormal
                    conditions where there has been loss of contact with reality. <b>Psychotic disorders</b> involve
                    significant impairment of reality testing and may include <b>delusions</b> (false beliefs),
                    <b>hallucinations</b> (false sensory perceptions), and bizarre behavior. Patients exhibit a
                    disturbed sense of self, inappropriate <b>affect</b> (emotional reactions), and withdrawal from the
                    external world.</div>

                        fears associated with a specific object or situation. The patient with a phobic disorder goes to
                        extreme lengths to avoid the object of her or his fear. The object that is feared often is
                        symbolic of an unconscious conflict that is the cause of the phobia and thus diverts the
                        patient’s attention from the conflict, keeping it unconscious. Panic attacks can occur in
                        anticipation of the phobic situation.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0520">Fear of being in open, crowded, public places from which escape would
                        be difficult is called <b>agoraphobia</b> (<b>agora-</b> = marketplace). This fear includes
                        going out alone in “unsafe places” in which help might not be available. Persons with
                        agoraphobia limit their normal activities to avoid situations that trigger their anxiety. Thus,
                        they may feel comfortable only when at home or in the company of a friend or relative. Other
                        specific phobias are <b>claustrophobia</b> (fear of closed-in places; <b>claustr/o</b> =
                        barrier), <b>acrophobia</b> (fear of heights; in this term, <b>acr/o</b> = a high point), and
                        <b>zoophobia</b> (fear of animals; <b>zo/o</b> = animals).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0525"><b>Social anxiety disorder</b> is the fear of situations in which the
                        affected person is open to public scrutiny, which could result in possible embarrassment and
                        humiliation. For example, the fear may focus on speaking in public, using public lavatories, or
                        eating in public.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0535"><b>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</b> is the development of

                        anxiety often triggered by reminders occur in episodes long after a life-threatening or major
                        emotional event. People avoid situations with reminders. Many survivors of the September 11,

                        are <b>anorexia nervosa</b> and <b>bulimia nervosa.</b> Anorexia nervosa is characterized by
                        refusal to maintain a minimal normal body weight. The affected person is intensely afraid of
                        gaining weight and has a disturbance in perception of the shape or size of her or his body. (The
                        term <b>anorexia,</b> meaning “lack of appetite,” is a misnomer because lack of appetite is
                        rare.) The condition predominantly affects adolescent females, and its principal symptom is a
                        conscious, relentless attempt to diet along with excessive, compulsive overactivity. Most
                        postmenarchal females with this disorder are amenorrheic.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0585">Bulimia nervosa (<b>bulimia</b> means abnormal increase in hunger) is
                        characterized by binge eating (uncontrolled indulgence in food) followed by purging (eliminating
                        food from the body). Persons with bulimia maintain normal or nearly normal weight because after
                        binging they engage in inappropriate purging. Examples of purging are self-induced vomiting and
                        the misuse of laxatives or enemas.</div>

                        disorientation, and behavioral changes, such as agitation and fear. It is caused by a variety of
                        conditions, including drug intoxication or withdrawal, seizures or head trauma, and metabolic
                        disturbances such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, or hepatic or renal failure.
                        <b>Delirium tremens</b> is brought on by stopping alcohol consumption suddenly after prolonged
                        periods of heavy alcohol ingestion. Delirium often responds to treatment and is of short

                        difficulty with language and with simple acts like dressing or brushing the teeth. Dementia may
                        be caused by conditions, some reversible and some progressive, involving damage to the brain.
                        The most common cause is <b>Alzheimer disease,</b> but other causes include cerebrovascular
                        disease (stroke), central nervous system (CNS) infection, certain medications and drugs, brain
                        trauma, tumors, and Parkinson and Huntington diseases. It is important to identify treatable
                        causes of dementia. A <b>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</b> is helpful in assessing
                        potential for dementia and cognitive impairment. It is a 30-point questionnaire that takes
                        between 5-10 minutes and examines recall, language, attention, verbal memory, and orientation.

                                person to person depending on how much is consumed and how often drinking occurs. Signs
                                of alcohol dependence and intoxication include slurred speech, unsteady gait, impairment
                                in attention or memory, stupor, or coma. Alcohol dependence often is associated with the
                                use of other psychoactive drugs. It also is associated with depression, as either a
                                cause or a consequence of the drinking.</li>
                            <li class="unnumlist" id="p0920"><a id="u0640" /><b>Amphetamines.</b> These CNS stimulants
                                are taken orally or administered intravenously. Examples are amphetamine (Benzedrine),
                                methamphetamine (Desoxyn, or “speed”), and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Some appetite
                                suppressants (diet pills) are amphetamine-like drugs. Psychological and behavioral
                                changes associated with dependence include anger, anxiety, impaired judgment, inability
                                to enjoy what was previously pleasurable, and social isolation. Physical signs and
                                symptoms include tachycardia or bradycardia, dilated pupils, nausea, elevated or low
                                blood pressure, and muscular weakness. Serious depression can occur during withdrawal.

                                includes all substances with psychoactive properties derived from the cannabis plant.
                                Examples are <b>marijuana,</b> hashish, and purified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
                                which is the major psychoactive ingredient in these substances. Psychological and

                                addictive stimulant drug made from the leaves of the coca plant native to South America.
                                It commonly is inhaled through nostrils or injected intravenously. Short-term effects
                                are euphoria and erratic or violent behavior. Possible long-term effects are loss of
                                sense of smell, nasal damage (nosebleeds), infection, and bowel necrosis from decreased
                                blood flow. Often, the user of cocaine also is dependent on alcohol or sedatives.</li>

                                anesthetics, or cough suppressants. Typical signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication
                                are pupillary constriction, euphoria, drowsiness, and slurred speech. Effects of
                                overdose are slow and shallow breathing, convulsions, coma, and possible death.</li>

                                with panic attacks. Examples are <b>benzodiazepines (BZDs),</b> which act rapidly as

                                schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses. They reduce anxiety,
                                tension, agitation, and aggressiveness and modify psychotic symptoms such as delusions

                                <b>Lithium</b> is commonly used to reduce the frequency and severity of manic symptoms,
                                such as rapid speech, hyperactive movements, grandiose ideas, agitation and
                                irritability, and impaired sleep patterns (decreased need for sleep is typical). It also
                                is used as an adjunct in the treatment of depression. Lithium is a simple salt that is

                                        of a young boy diagnosed with autism.</i></div>

                                    will be able to live on his own as an adult or whether he will have to live in a
                                    facility.”</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1145">I was told this by a physician when my son, Jeff, was
                                    diagnosed with autism.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1150">It began early on. For the first year of his life, Jeff
                                    had difficulty tolerating many situations and often cried. Loud noises such as
                                    barking dogs, motorcycles, and the trash truck sent him into a crying frenzy. If he
                                    was in a quiet room, in a swing, or being held, he was comfortable. Most other
                                    situations he could tolerate for only 60 to 90 minutes, after which he would cry for
                                    20 to 30 minutes as if relieving stress. As Jeff aged, his tolerance slowly
                                    increased, but even at the age of 4, overstimulation caused him to cry daily.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1155">Jeff experienced numerous other challenges as well. His
                                    ability to play was impaired. If a toy did not light up or play music he was not
                                    interested in it. The exception was Matchbox cars, which he did enjoy. However, he
                                    did not play with them appropriately. He merely lined them up. Jeff never engaged in
                                    imaginative play, nor could he carry on a back-and-forth conversation. His speech
                                    was rote, and he had extreme difficulty communicating and relating to peers.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1160">After visiting several doctors in search of a diagnosis,
                                    we were told Jeff had autism. We also learned that his discomfort and crying were a
                                    result of sensory integration challenges that children on the autism spectrum
                                    experience. Sensory integration is the process of organizing useful perceptions,
                                    emotions and thoughts. When sensory integration is whole and balanced, body
                                    movements are highly adaptive and good behavior is a natural outcome. This was not
                                    the case with Jeff.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1165">It was difficult to accept the diagnosis, but we had to
                                    move on. The next step was finding proper treatment. After much consideration, we
                                    decided on DIR/Floortime [Developmental, Individual Difference,
                                    Relationship-Based–Floortime] Therapy (“Floortime”), supplemented with occupational
                                    therapy (OT), to address Jeff’s sensory integration needs.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1170">Floortime is a play-based treatment, focusing on helping
                                    children master the building blocks of relating, communicating, and thinking. Guided
                                    interactions between the child and parent, sibling, grandparent, or caregiver move
                                    the child through Floortime developmental stages.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1175">I was taught Floortime by a professional and spent
                                    innumerable hours watching instructional videos and reading Floortime books. I
                                    worked with Jeff each day, even during meals, bath time, and riding in the car. I
                                    was working for my son’s future. The more therapy he received, the better his
                                    chances of “recovery.” No opportunity was missed.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1180">Each week, over the course of several years, our program
                                    leader would assess Jeff’s development and determine when he had mastered a skill
                                    and when further interventions were needed.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1185">While Floortime was resolving Jeff’s developmental
                                    issues, another problem was becoming more evident. By first grade, Jeff had
                                    developed anxiety so irrational and overwhelming that it impaired his school, social
                                    and family life. He was very fearful and always thinking about the worst things that
                                    could happen. Jeff was not only verbalizing his anxiety, but it manifested in other
                                    unconscious behavior such as eye and verbal tics, chewing on his shirt, and pulling
                                    on his hair.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1190">While doctors did not have a specific answer for Jeff’s
                                    anxiety, we tried numerous treatments such as psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral
                                    therapy. None had much effect on reducing Jeff’s anxiety.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1195">Finally we were directed to a program at a nearby
                                    university specifically designed for children on the autism spectrum suffering from
                                    very high levels of anxiety. It taught Jeff how his anxiety could be managed by
                                    using a coping plan and actively facing his fears. We used this targeted cognitive
                                    behavioral technique for over a year, and it had a noticeable positive impact on
                                    Jeff’s anxiety.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1200">By his fourth-grade year, his physical size and weight
                                    allowed his child psychiatrist to prescribe antianxiety medication. This has made a
                                    real difference in his functioning and well being.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1205">Jeff is now a is a mainstreamed student at a public
                                    middle school. He is able to relate to others with real warmth. He has a core group
                                    of good friends, a love of learning, and a mischievous sense of humor. His anxiety
                                    still remains his biggest challenge but is under control with medication and
                                    psychotherapy.</div>

                                            the emergency department by her daughter, who found her at home in bed in
                                            the middle of the day. For a period of months, Mrs. Carr had become
                                            increasingly withdrawn and dysphoric, without any precipitating events. She
                                            had become progressively less active and even required encouragement to eat
                                            and perform her daily tasks. Her daughter and son-in-law became alarmed but
                                            did not know what to do. Mrs. Carr’s medical history was unremarkable, but
                                            her psychiatric history revealed an episode of postpartum depression after
                                            the birth of one of her children.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="p1215">On examination, the ER [emergency room] physician
                                            noted that Mrs. Carr was withdrawn and negativistic, refusing to cooperate
                                            with the examination, and even refusing to open her mouth. There were signs
                                            of acute dehydration and decline in personal hygiene and grooming.</div>

                                            Mrs. Carr had become increasingly paranoid and had delusions of sinfulness
                                            and guilt. Recently, she had shown signs of increasing mutism.</div>

                                            life, the patient evidently had been dominated by a tyrannical father who
                                            never gave him the love he craved. When the patient was 29, his father died
                                            of carcinoma of the colon, and soon afterward, the patient developed
                                            abdominal pain. His complaints gradually increased as his identification
                                            with his father, as well as his unconscious hostility toward him, increased.
                                            The patient came to the clinic almost daily with complaints of bloody stools
                                            (the feces were found to be free of blood) and the belief that he had
                                            cancer. He felt that none of the clinic doctors listened to him, just as his

                                            allowed the patient time to talk about the illness. His symptoms gradually

                                            depression at age 26, characterized by sadness lasting most of the day,
                                            crying spells, severe irritability, hypersomnia with some periods of
                                            insomnia, anergia (low energy), severe inappropriate guilt feelings, and
                                            absence of libido (sex drive). The patient also described periods of high
                                            energy when her “mind ran away,” and her mood was irritable, with a
                                            decreased need for sleep. She stated that initially, these times would last
                                            1 or 2 days at the most. Her family would avoid confrontations with her
                                            during those periods of energy and activity. The patient had previously been
                                            diagnosed as suffering from dysthymic disorder with major depression. A
                                            bipolar illness was suspected based on her 1- or 2-day bursts of energy and
                                            activity. History from family members confirmed that she had experienced
                                            expansive mood states lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most
                                            of the day that met the DSM-5 TR criteria for hypomanic episodes. Her
                                            diagnosis was changed to bipolar II disorder. She was placed on a regimen of
                                            bupropion (Wellbutrin), and the dose was increased to 300 mg/day. Her mood
                                            improved in a general way, with less irritability, more energy, and less
                                            sadness. She continued to have rather pronounced premenstrual worsening of
                                            her mood, however, that did not respond to an increase in the dose of
                                            bupropion. In the meantime, her physician added lithium to her medical
                                            regimen of fluoxetine (Prozac).<span role="doc-pagebreak"

                                            children, ages 8 and 10, whom he rarely ever sees. He has never been
                                            evaluated by a psychiatrist. His family physician has tried to get him to
                                            see a local psychiatrist, but Mike refuses to go. Mike says he knows someone
                                            has removed his brain and replaced it with someone else’s. He believes that
                                            this brain is controlling him and that he is not responsible for his
                                            actions. He works every day and has been on his current job for 15 years. He
                                            says he has lots of friends, but sometimes he thinks it’s one of them who
                                            did this to him. He reports incidents in which he has been injected with
                                            something while shopping and speaks of a government conspiracy to kill him.
                                            He has a college education and has a degree in computer science. His family
                                            physician ordered an MRI study, which showed negative findings, and he also
                                            had an EEG. The EEG results came back normal.</div>

                                        <div class="b1textfl" id="p1250">John was admitted to an opioid rehabilitation
                                            center in 2021 after overdosing on fentanyl-laced heroin, which he obtained
                                            on the street and injected intravenously. Fentanyl is a very potent
                                            synthetic narcotic, highly addictive, and prone to cause respiratory arrest.
                                            John had recovered in the hospital after a week of slowly awakening, nearly
                                            dying due to respiratory depression. He required mechanical ventilation
                                            (intubation) and blood pressure support for hypotension, as well as
                                            treatment for aspiration pneumonia.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="p1255">John’s addiction began several years earlier when
                                            he underwent surgery for a torn knee ligament suffered in a football game.
                                            To cope with the post-operative pain he was prescribed oxycodone (a short
                                            acting opioid) and then oxycontin (a longer acting, highly addictive
                                            medication). He liked the “high” provided by the drug and continued to
                                            obtain it on the street for several months afterward, but switched to the
                                            cheaper opioid heroin. This was his second episode of overdose.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="p1260">At the rehab center, he was switched to suboxone
                                            (prescription drug used to treat opioid dependence), a well-tolerated pill
                                            taken once per day, and has remained on it for the past two years. He
                                            functions well in a daily job at a call center.</div>
