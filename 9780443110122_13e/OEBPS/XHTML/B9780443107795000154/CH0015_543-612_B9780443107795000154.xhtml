                <div class="textfl" id="p0210">The musculoskeletal system includes the bones, muscles, and joints. All
                    have important functions in the body.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0215"><b>Bones</b> provide the framework on which the body is constructed and
                    protect and support internal organs. Bones also assist the body in movement, because they serve as a
                    point of attachment for muscles. The inner core of bones is composed of hematopoietic tissue (red
                    bone marrow, which manufactures blood cells), whereas outer parts of bone are storage areas for
                    minerals necessary for growth, such as calcium and phosphorus.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0220"><b>Joints</b> are the places at which bones come together. Several
                    different types of joints are found within the body. The type of joint found in any specific
                    location is determined by the need for greater or lesser flexibility of movement.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0225"><b>Muscles,</b> whether attached to bones or to internal organs and blood
                    vessels, are responsible for movement. Internal movement involves the contraction and relaxation of
                    muscles found in viscera, and external movement is accomplished by the contraction and relaxation of
                    muscles that are attached to the bones. <b>Tendons</b> are connective tissue that bind muscles to
                    bones, while <b>ligaments</b> bind bones to other bones.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0230"><b>Orthopedists</b> are physicians who treat (surgically and medically)
                    bone, joint, and muscle conditions. Originally, orthopedics was a branch of medicine correcting
                    deformities in children (<b>orth/o</b> means straight, <b>ped/o</b> means child).
                    <b>Rheumatologists</b> are physicians (nonsurgical) who specialize primarily in joint problems, such
                    as arthritis; in this context, <b>rheumat/o,</b> meaning watery flow, refers to joint fluid.
                    <b>Physiatrists</b> are medical doctors whose focus is on rehabilitation after injury or illness to
                    muscles, bones, and nerves.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0235">Both a <b>medical doctor (MD)</b> and an <b>doctor of osteopathy (DO)</b>
                    can specialize in orthopedics, rheumatology, or physiatry. MD and DO medical education programs are
                    similar, and both kinds of physicians perform surgery as well as prescribe medication. An osteopath
                    has added training in the musculoskeletal system, with an emphasis on body mechanics to promote good
                    health. A <b>chiropractor</b> (<b>chir/o</b> means hand) is not a physician but has extensive and
                    specialized training in using physical means to manipulate the spinal column, joints, and soft
                    tissues.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0240">A <b>physical therapist</b> is a doctoral degree–prepared health care
                    professional who develops a treatment plan based on a patient’s physical impairments with or without
                    a physician diagnosis. The goals of physical therapy (PT) are to restore function, improve mobility,
                    and relieve pain. <b>Athletic trainers</b> are health care professionals who, working with a
                    physician, provide therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions.
                    Training includes a bachelor’s or master’s degree from an accredited school. Passing a certification
                    examination also is required to work in this field.</div>

                            cells), dense connective tissue strands known as <b>collagen,</b> and intercellular
                            <b>calcium salts.</b><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="545"

                        <div class="text" id="p0250">During fetal development, the bones of the fetus are composed of
                            <b>cartilage,</b> which resembles osseous tissue but is more flexible and less dense because
                            of a lack of calcium salts in its intercellular spaces. As the embryo develops, the process
                            of depositing calcium salts in the soft, cartilaginous tissue occurs and continues
                            throughout the life of the individual after birth. The gradual replacement of cartilage and
                            its intercellular substance by immature bone cells and calcium deposits is called
                            <b>ossification</b> (bone formation).</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0255"><b>Osteoblasts</b> (<b>-blast</b> is from the Greek word meaning to
                            bud or sprout) are the immature osteocytes that produce the bony tissue replacing cartilage
                            during ossification. <b>Osteoclasts</b> (<b>-clast</b> is from the Greek word meaning to
                            break) are large cells that function to reabsorb, or digest, bony tissue. Osteoclasts (also
                            called <b>bone phagocytes</b>) digest bone tissue from the inner sides of bones thus
                            enlarging the inner bone cavity so that the bone does not become overly thick and heavy.
                            When a bone breaks, osteoblasts lay down the mineral bone matter (calcium salts) and
                            osteoclasts remove excess bone debris (smooth out the bone).</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0260">Osteoblasts and osteoclasts work together in all bones throughout
                            life, tearing down (osteoclasts) and rebuilding (osteoblasts) bony tissue. This allows bone
                            to respond to mechanical stresses placed on it and thus enables it to be a living tissue,
                            constantly rebuilding and renewing itself. This process is known as bone remodeling.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0265">The formation of bone depends largely on a proper supply of
                            <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> to the bone tissue. These minerals must be taken into
                            the body along with a sufficient amount of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps calcium to pass
                            through the lining of the small intestine and into the bloodstream. Once calcium and
                            phosphorus are in the bones, osteoblastic activity produces an enzyme that forms calcium
                            phosphate, a substance that gives bone its characteristic hard quality. It is the major
                            calcium salt.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0270">Not only are calcium and phosphorus part of the hard structure of
                            bone tissue, but calcium is also present in the bloodstream. If the proper amount of calcium
                            is lacking in the blood, nerve fibers are unable to transmit impulses effectively to
                            muscles, the heart muscle becomes weak, and muscles attached to bones undergo spasms.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0275">The necessary level of calcium in the blood is maintained by the
                            parathyroid gland, which secretes a hormone that signals the release of calcium from bone
                            storage. An excess of the hormone (caused by tumor or another pathologic process) will raise
                            blood calcium at the expense of the bones, which become weakened by the loss of calcium.

                                bones</b> are found in the thigh, lower leg, and upper and lower arm. These bones are
                            very strong, are broad at the ends where they join with other bones, and have large surface

                            the skull, shoulder blades, ribs, and pelvic bones. <b>Sesamoid bones</b> are small, rounded
                            bones (resembling a sesame seed in shape). They are found near joints, and they increase the
                            efficiency of the tendons at a particular joint. The kneecap is the largest example of a

                        <div class="text" id="p0295">The shaft, or middle region, of a long bone is called the
                            <b>diaphysis</b> [1]. Each end of a long bone is called an <b>epiphysis</b> [2]. The
                            <b>epiphyseal line</b> or <b>plate</b> [3] represents an area of cartilage tissue that is
                            constantly being replaced by new bone tissue as the bone grows; it also is commonly known as
                            the growth plate. Cartilage cells at the edges of the epiphyseal plate form new bone, which
                            is responsible for lengthening bones during childhood and adolescence. The plate calcifies
                            and disappears when the bone has achieved its full growth. The <b>metaphysis</b> [4] is the
                            flared portion of the bone; it lies between the epiphysis and the diaphysis. It is adjacent
                            to the epiphyseal plate.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0300">The <b>periosteum</b> [5] is a strong, fibrous, vascular membrane
                            that covers the surface of long bones, except at the ends of the epiphyses. It has an
                            extensive nerve supply as well. All bones are covered by periosteum.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0305">The ends of long bones and the surface of any bone that meets
                            another bone to form a joint are covered with <b>articular cartilage</b> [6]. When two bones
                            come together to form a joint, the bones themselves do not touch precisely. The articular
                            cartilage that caps the end of one bone comes into contact with that of the other bone.
                            Articular cartilage is a very smooth, strong, and slick tissue. It cushions the joint and
                            allows it to move smoothly and efficiently. Unlike the cartilage of the epiphyseal plate,
                            which disappears when a bone achieves its full growth, articular cartilage is present
                            throughout life.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="547"

                        <div class="text" id="p0310"><b>Compact (cortical) bone</b> [7] is a layer of hard, dense bone
                            that lies under the periosteum in all bones and is located chiefly around the diaphysis of
                            long bones. Within the compact bone is a system of small canals containing blood vessels
                            that bring oxygen and nutrients to the bone and remove waste products such as carbon
                            dioxide. <a href="#f0015">Figure 15-1B</a> shows these channels, called <b>haversian
                                canals</b> [8], in the compact bone. Compact bone is tunneled out in the central shaft
                            of the long bones by a <b>medullary cavity</b> [9] that contains <b>yellow bone marrow.</b>
                            Yellow marrow is composed chiefly of fat cells.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0315"><b>Cancellous bone</b> [10], sometimes called <b>spongy</b> or
                            <b>trabecular bone,</b> is much more porous and less dense than compact bone. The mineral
                            matter in it is laid down in a series of separated bony fibers that make up a spongy
                            latticework. These interwoven fibers, called <b>trabeculae,</b> are found largely in the
                            epiphyses and metaphyses of long bones and in the middle portion of most other bones of the
                            body as well. Spaces in cancellous bone contain <b>red bone marrow.</b> The red marrow
                            consists of immature and mature blood cells in various stages of development.
                            <b>Hematopoiesis</b> (-poiesis means formation) is the production of all types of blood
                            cells in the bone marrow.</div>

                            within cancellous tissue. Red marrow in the medullary cavity of long bones is plentiful in
                            young children but decreases through the years and is replaced by yellow marrow.</div>

                        tailbone. The bones are separated by pads of cartilage called <b>intervertebral discs</b>.</div>

                                    the longest bone in the body. At its proximal end it has a rounded head that fits
                                    into a depression, or socket, in the pelvis. This socket is called the
                                    <b>acetabulum.</b> The acetabulum was named because of its resemblance to a rounded
                                    cup the Romans used for vinegar <i>(acetum)</i>. The head of the femur and the
                                    acetabulum form a ball-and-socket joint otherwise known as the <b>hip joint.</b> See

                                    small, flat bone that lies in front of the articulation between the femur and one of
                                    the lower leg bones called the tibia. It is a sesamoid bone surrounded by protective
                                    tendons and held in place by muscle attachments. Together with the femur and the
                                    tibia, it forms the <b>knee joint</b>.</li>

                                    bones of the lower leg; the tibia runs under the skin in the front part of the leg.
                                    It joins with the femur and patella proximally, and at its distal end (ankle) forms
                                    a flare that is the bony prominence (medial <b>malleolus</b>) at the inside of the
                                    ankle. The tibia commonly is called the <b>shinbone.</b></li>

                                    lower leg bones; this thin bone, well hidden under the leg muscles, runs parallel to
                                    the tibia. At its distal part, it forms a flare, which is the bony prominence
                                    (lateral <b>malleolus</b>) on the outside of the ankle. The tibia, fibula, and
                                    <b>talus</b> (the first of the tarsal bones) come together to form the <b>ankle

                                    wrist but are larger. The <b>calcaneus</b> is the largest of these bones and also is

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0700">A <b>joint (articulation)</b> is a coming together of two or more
                        bones. Some joints are immovable, such as the <b>suture joints</b> between the skull bones.
                        Other joints, such as those between the vertebrae, are partially movable. Most joints, however,
                        allow considerable movement. These freely movable joints are called <b>synovial joints.</b>
                        Examples of synovial joints are the ball-and-socket type (the hip and shoulder joints) and the
                        hinge type (elbow, knee, and ankle joints). Label the structures in <a href="#f0105"
                            id="Bf0105">Figure 15-19</a> as you read about a synovial joint.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0705">The bones in a synovial joint are surrounded by a <b>joint capsule</b>
                        [1] composed of fibrous tissue. <b>Ligaments</b> (thickened fibrous bands of connective tissue)
                        anchor one bone to another and thereby add considerable strength to the joint capsule in
                        critical areas. Bones at the joint are covered with a smooth, glistening white tissue called the
                        <b>articular cartilage</b> [2]. The <b>synovial membrane</b> [3] lies under the joint capsule
                        and lines the <b>synovial cavity</b> [4] between the bones. The synovial cavity is filled with a
                        special lubricating, slick fluid produced by the synovial membrane. <b>Synovial fluid</b>
                        contains water and nutrients to nourish articular cartilage so that joint movement is nearly
                        frictionless.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0710">A <b>meniscus</b> is a crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure
                        that partly divides a joint cavity and acts as a protective cushion. It helps to evenly transfer
                        weight from one bone to another. Menisci are present in a few joints in the body, but the most
                        well known are in the knee (see <a href="#f0110" id="Bf0110">Figure 15-20</a>).</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0715"><b>Bursae</b> (<i>singular</i>: <b>bursa</b>) are closed sacs of
                        synovial fluid lined with a synovial membrane and are located near but not within a joint.
                        Bursae are present wherever two types of tissue need to slide past one another with as little
                        friction as possible. Bursae serve as layers of lubrication between tissues. Common sites are
                        between <b>tendons</b> and bones, between <b>ligaments</b> and bones, and between skin and bones
                        in areas where bony anatomy is prominent.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0720">Some common locations of bursae are at the elbow joint (olecranon
                        bursa), knee joint (prepatellar bursa), and shoulder joint (subacromial bursa). <a

                        fibers that wrap around tubes and vessels while skeletal muscle fibers are arranged in bundles.

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0795">Skeletal (striated) muscles (more than 600 in the human body) are the
                        muscles that move bones and joints. <a href="#f0160" id="Bf0160">Figure 15-30</a> shows some
                        skeletal muscles of the head, neck, and torso and muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg.
                        When a muscle contracts, one of the bones to which it is joined remains virtually stationary as
                        a result of other muscles that hold it in place. The point of attachment of the muscle to the
                        stationary bone is called the <b>origin (beginning)</b> of that muscle. When the muscle
                        contracts, however, another bone to which it is attached does move. The point of junction of the
                        muscle to the bone that moves is called the <b>insertion</b> of the muscle. Most often, the
                        origin of a muscle lies proximal in the skeleton, whereas its insertion lies distal.</div>

                                    hole and instead of hitting the ball, I hit the ground, I immediately knew that I
                                    had done severe damage to my left shoulder. The club flew out of my hands, and I
                                    felt excruciating pain.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0865">Over the next few weeks, I iced the shoulder and took
                                    NSAIDs, but the pain and inability to move my shoulder persisted. After several
                                    weeks of physical therapy that didn’t improve my mobility or pain, I went to an
                                    orthopedic surgeon who specialized in shoulders. He suspected a torn rotator cuff.
                                    The <b>rotator cuff</b> is a group of muscles and tendons that stabilize, move, and
                                    provide strength to the shoulder joint. [See <a href="#f0205" id="Bf0205">Figure
                                        15-38A</a> for a diagram of the anatomy of shoulder and rotator cuff tendons and
                                    muscles.] An MRI of my shoulder made the diagnosis. [See <a href="#f0205">Figure
                                        15-38B</a> for an MRI scan.]</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0870">I was told that rotator cuff tears rarely repair
                                    themselves, but some people gradually get used to the limited mobility, strength,
                                    and diminished pain. The other alternative is arthroscopic surgery [see <a
                                        href="#f0205">Figure 15-38C</a>] to repair the torn tendons. I decided to have
                                    the surgery, which consisted of drilling into the head of the humerus and pulling
                                    the tendon (with surgical sutures) to the bone [humerus] to reinsert it in place.
                                    [See <a href="#f0205">Figure 15-38D</a>.]</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0875">After surgery, I found myself strapped into an elaborate
                                    sling to protect my shoulder for over 6 weeks. The rehabilitation was tough and
                                    consisted of physical therapy and slow return to activity, but it was worth it as I
                                    can now get back on the golf course!</div>

                                <div class="b1text" id="p1050">I was born with a right congenital hip dysplasia and put
                                    into iron braces until I could walk normally. At 11 months, the braces were removed
                                    and I was deemed healthy, but my right foot, always turned outward. It never got in
                                    my way and held up for over 100 marathons, until 2012 when I started tripping while
                                    running on trails and developed back pain. A friend mentioned that it looked as
                                    though I wasn’t lifting my right leg as high as my left. I also noticed a deep
                                    aching pain in my groin, a telltale sign of hip pathology. In the spring of 2016, at
                                    the advice of my chiropractor, I had an x-ray of my pelvis with two views of my
                                    right hip. The diagnosis was right hip severe osteoarthritis, bone on bone (<a
                                        href="#f9010">Figure 15-41A and B</a>).</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1055">The prognosis for this sort of condition can be variable.
                                    Some people can avoid joint replacement for years, with limited activity, but I was
                                    having pain with any flexion of my hip. In December of 2016, I had a corticosteroid
                                    injection into the joint space with the goal of reducing some of the inflammation
                                    resulting from the femoral head rubbing against the acetabulum. By that time, my
                                    only painless motion was lateral, where my hip could rotate without osteophytes and
                                    bone spurs limiting motion. Over the years I had worn down my femoral head so that
                                    it was no longer round but rather flat from bone rubbing on bone. (See <a
                                        href="#f9010">Figure 15-41C</a>.) Although I took NSAID’s for pain during the
                                    day, when the pain kept me awake all night, despite medication, I decided to look
                                    into hip replacement.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1060">Artificial hips are comprised of three components: the
                                    titanium femoral stem, the femoral head of either cobalt-chromium or ceramic, and
                                    the acetabular portion, which can be metal with a polyethylene liner. See <a
                                        href="#f9010">Figure 15-41D</a>. Because I wanted an approach that did not cut
                                    through any muscle and with the lowest dislocation risk, I decided upon an anterior
                                    approach. The anterior approach is best conducted using a special table that can
                                    provide an ideal approach to the femur. The entire procedure took about 60 minutes
                                    (see postoperative x-ray in <a href="#f9010">Figure 15-41E</a>) and within 6 hours
                                    they had me reluctantly up and walking on my new hip.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1065">The most challenging part of the post-op period was
                                    extreme nausea resulting from the anesthesia and narcotics used to curb my
                                    postoperative pain, so I decided to discontinue the narcotics. Because I was lying
                                    in the hospital bed for hours on end, only getting up for physical therapy (PT) and
                                    use of the toilet, I wore compression hose and special boots that inflated and
                                    deflated on schedule to move blood through my legs. This prevented deep vein
                                    thromboses. I also was put on a blood thinner (anticoagulant) to prevent dangerous
                                    clots, which could easily migrate to my lungs (pulmonary emboli).</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1070">Over a period of a week, I gradually grew stronger. I
                                    progressed from a walker to using a cane in my left hand. I practiced using my
                                    stronger left leg first going up stairs and my weaker right leg–cane combination
                                    first when going down stairs. I took it slowly. I iced my hip constantly, never
                                    going anywhere or lying down without ice packs to reduce the inflammation, pain, and
                                    swelling.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p1075">Increasing my walking and adding daily PT helped me feel
                                    stable on my feet within a few weeks. My surgeon hypothesized that by 6 weeks, I
                                    would feel confident on my new hip and could take on aerobic exercise gradually from
                                    there. I couldn’t wait. One thing that I noticed right away was that the muscles in
                                    my right leg (hip replacement leg) had atrophied. I needed to build muscle with a
                                    combination of good nutrition and exercise. I began with the pool, walking back and
                                    forth in the swimming lane, and began swimming laps for daily exercise. I continued
                                    with exercises recommended by my physical therapist and added ankle weights to
