The urinary system removes these nitrogenous wastes from the blood so that they do not accumulate and become harmful. As blood passes through the kidneys, the kidneys filter nitrogenous wastes to form <b>urine</b> (composed of water, salts, and acids). Urine leaves the body through the ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Every day, the kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to filter out 2 quarts of urine.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0140">Besides removing urea and other nitrogenous wastes from the blood, the kidneys maintain the proper balance of water, electrolytes, and acids in body fluids. <b>Electrolytes</b> such as <b>sodium (Na</b><sup>+</sup><b>)</b> and <b>potassium (K</b><sup>+</sup><b>)</b> are small molecules that conduct an electrical charge. Electrolytes are necessary for proper functioning of muscle and nerve cells. The kidney adjusts the amounts of water and electrolytes by secreting some substances into the urine and holding back others in the bloodstream for use in the body. This is an example of <b>homeostasis,</b> which is the body’s ability to maintain an equilibrium within its internal environment. Home/o means sameness.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0145">In addition to forming and excreting (eliminating) urine from the body, the kidneys secrete an enzyme called <b>renin</b> (RE-nin) and a hormone called <b>erythropoietin</b> (eh-rith-ro-POY-it-in). <b>Renin</b> raises blood pressure (to keep blood moving through the kidney). <b>Erythropoietin (EPO)</b> stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0150">The kidneys also secrete <b>calciferol,</b> an active form of vitamin D, necessary for the absorption of calcium from the intestine.

Each <b>glomerulus</b> (singular) is a collection of tiny capillaries formed in the shape of a small ball. There are about 1 million glomeruli in the cortex region of each kidney.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0205">The kidneys produce urine by <b>filtration.</b> As blood passes through the many glomeruli, the thin walls of each glomerulus (the filter) permit water, salts, sugar, and <b>urea</b> (with other nitrogenous wastes such as <b>creatinine</b> and <b>uric acid</b>) to leave the bloodstream. These materials collect in a tiny, cup-like structure, a <b>glomerular (Bowman) capsule,</b> that surrounds each glomerulus (<a href="#f0025">Figure 7-4B</a>). The walls of the glomeruli prevent large substances, such as proteins and blood cells, from filtering into the urine. These substances remain in the blood and normally do not appear in urine.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0210">Attached to each glomerular capsule is a long, twisted tube called a <b>renal tubule</b> (<a href="#f0025">Figure 7-4B</a>; see also <a href="#f0030" id="Bf0030">Figure 7-5</a>). As water, sugar, salts, urea, and other wastes pass through the renal tubule, most of the water, all of the sugar, and almost all of the sodium return to the bloodstream through tiny capillaries surrounding each tubule. This active process of <b>reabsorption</b> ensures that the body retains essential substances such as sugar (glucose), water, and sodium while allowing waste products to be excreted in the urine. The final process in the formation of urine is <b>secretion</b> of some substances such as potassium, acids, and drugs from the bloodstream into the renal tubule. Each renal tubule, now containing urine (95% water and 5% urea, creatinine, salts, and acids) connects to a larger collecting tubule.</div>					<div class="text" id="p0215">See <a href="#f0030">Figure 7-5A</a>, which reviews the steps involved in urine formation.

However, in some infections of the bladder, the urine pH may be alkaline, owing to the actions of bacteria in the urine that break down urea and release ammonia (an alkaline substance).</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0270"><a id="o0025" />4. <b>Protein</b>—Small amounts of protein are normally found in the urine but not in sufficient quantity to produce a positive result by ordinary methods of testing. When urinary tests for protein become positive, <b>albumin</b> is usually responsible. Albumin is the major protein in blood plasma. If it is detected in urine <b>(albuminuria),</b> it may indicate a leak in the glomerular membrane, which allows albumin to enter the renal tubule and pass into the urine.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="217" id="pagebreak_217" /><a id="pg217" /></li>							<li>								<div class="pageavoid">									<figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780443107795000075/main.assets/f07-12-9780443107795.jpg" alt="image" aria-describedby="LD013" />										<figcaption class='figleg'><a id="cap0065" /><a id="fspara0065" /><span class="fignum"><a href="#Bf0065">FIGURE 7-12</a></span> <b>The pH scale.</b> Pure water has a neutral pH.</figcaption>									</figure>									<p class="sr-only" id="LD013">The pH scale ranges from negative 1 to 14 shows data as follows: Negative 1, hydrochloric acid; 0, lead-acid battery; 2, gastric acid; 3, vinegar; 4, tomato juice; 5, coffee, beer; 6,milk; 6.5, urine; 7, pure water; 7.5, blood; 8, ocean water; 10, hand soap; 12, ammonia; 13, bleach; and 14, lye.</p>								</div>							</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0275">    Through more sensitive testing, smaller abnormal amounts of albumin may be detected, revealing <b>microalbuminuria,</b> when ordinary tests are negative.

It is a comparison of the density of urine with that of water. The urine of patients with diabetes mellitus has a higher-than-normal specific gravity because of the presence of sugar.</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0290"><a id="o0040" />7. <b>Ketone bodies</b>—Ketones (or <b>acetones,</b> a type of ketone body) are formed when fatty acids are broken down in the liver. Ketones accumulate in blood and urine when the body breaks down fat, instead of sugar, for fuel. <b>Ketonuria</b> occurs in diabetes mellitus when cells deprived of sugar must use up their available fat for energy. In starvation, when sugar is not available, ketonuria and ketosis (ketones in the blood) occur as fat is catabolized abnormally.</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0295">    Ketones in the blood are dangerous because they increase the acidity of the blood <b>(ketoacidosis).</b> If severe, this may lead to coma (unconsciousness) and death.</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0300"><a id="o0045" />8. <b>Sediment and casts</b>—The presence of abnormal particles in the urine is a sign of a pathologic condition. Such particles, which may settle to the bottom of a urine sample as <b>sediment</b>, may include cells (epithelial, white, or red blood cells), bacteria, crystals, and <b>casts</b> (cylindric structures of protein often containing cellular elements).</li>							<li class="numlist" id="p0305"><a id="o0050" />9. <b>Phenylketonuria (PKU)</b>—This is a rare condition in which a baby is born unable to break down an amino acid, phenylalanine. Resulting high blood levels of phenylalanine (<i>phenylketones</i> are detected in urine) can lead to intellectual disability. Although the PKU test originally was performed on urine specimens, now it is done by pricking the newborn’s heel to obtain a small blood sample. If phenylalanine is detected, the infant is fed a diet excluding phenylalanine. Affected children remain on this diet until adulthood.</li>							<li class="numlista" id="p0310"><a id="o0055" />10. <b>Bilirubin</b>—A small amount of this pigment substance is present in urine and gives its distinctive yellow color.

Five years later, dialysis was taking its toll on his organ systems, and there had been no success in obtaining a cadaveric kidney. Things had reached the point where he needed a kidney in short order, before his health deteriorated to the point where he would no longer be a candidate for transplantation.</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0330">My wife’s blood type ruled out the possibility of her being a direct donor, so I volunteered to be tested. Turns out that her father and I were a match on 5 of the 7 key traits—a really good fit! The next round of testing—blood work and my kidney function—was able to be done locally. I remember carrying around a specimen container (on ice), having to provide a full liter of urine in 24 hours!</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0335">The results of those tests were favorable, and two weeks later I made the 3½-hour drive to the transplant center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. While a transplant is really a team of two—donor and recipient—the entire process at UVA was very much individualized. A transplant coordinator (an experienced RN) was assigned specifically to our case, and I had a team of doctors and support staff dedicated exclusively to me, the donor. Similarly, there was a team that dealt only with my father-in-law as the recipient.</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0340">My visit involved some more in-depth blood tests and cardiac studies largely to determine that I was healthy enough for major surgery. My transplant team and I spent an entire afternoon discussing the implications of being a donor—the inherent risk in any surgery, potential implications for me and my family, the likely recovery time, and the possibility that, despite all of the up-front testing, the transplant might not be successful. The discussions that afternoon only reaffirmed that I was making the right decision. I had an opportunity to have a positive impact on someone else’s life, with relatively little risk to my own health.</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0345">The events around the surgery itself were pretty straightforward. The surgery is a more involved procedure for the donor than for the recipient, so I was taken back first. A nurse started an IV and injected a mild sedative. From that point, my only memory is of one last hug for my wife and children, and then being shifted from the stretcher onto the operating table.</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0350">When I woke up in recovery, the news was all good. My surgery had gone well—four laparoscopic incisions through which the surgeons did most all of their work, and a lateral incision in my lower abdomen through which the kidney was removed. Equally important, my father-in-law had come through his surgery well and the kidney had immediately begun to function! I was discharged from the hospital on Sunday, and cleared to return home the next Friday, 8 days post-op.</div>									<div class="b1text" id="bpar0355">As is typical following a major surgery, it took about 6 weeks for me to feel “normal” again. During those 6 weeks, I had weekly blood tests to chart the progress of my kidney function. I went back to UVA for a routine follow-up visit at the 6-week mark. I was recovering as expected, and my remaining kidney was actually growing in size and capacity.
